\\nfebruary 1, 2024  \\nhon’ble speaker,  \\n i present the interim budget for 2024 -25.  \\nintroduction  \\n1. the indian  economy  has witnessed profound positive \\ntransformation in the last ten years. the people of india are \\nlooking ahead to the future with hope and optimism.  \\n2. with the blessings of the people, when our government \\nunder the visionary and dynamic leadership of hon’ble prime \\nminister shri narendra modi assumed office in 2014, the country \\nwas facing enormous challenges. with ‘sabka saath, sabka \\nvikas’  as its ‘mantra’ , the government overcame those \\nchallenges in right earnest. structural reforms were undertaken. \\npro-people programmes were formulated and implemented \\npromptly. conditions were cr eated for more opportunities for \\nemployment and entrepreneurship. the economy got a new \\nvigour. the fruits of development started reaching the people at \\nscale. the country got a new sense of purpose and hope. \\nnaturally, the people blessed the government wi th a bigger \\nmandate.  2 \\n 3. in the second term, our government under the leadership \\nof hon’ble prime minister doubled down on its responsibilities to \\nbuild a prosperous country with comprehensive development of \\nall people and all regions. our government strengthened its \\n‘mantra’  to ‘sabka saath, sabka vikas, and sabka vishwas’. our \\ndevelopment philosophy covered all elements of inclusivity, \\nnamely,  \\n\\uf0b7 social inclusivity through coverage of all strata of the \\nsociety, and  \\n\\uf0b7 geographical  inclusivity through development of all \\nregions of the country.   \\n4. with the ‘whole of nation’ approach of ‘sabka prayas’, t he \\ncountry overcame the challenge of a once -in-a-century \\npandemic, took long strides towards ‘atmanirbhar bharat’, \\ncommitted to ‘panch  pran’ , and laid solid foundations for the  \\n‘amrit kaal’. as a result, our young country has high aspiration s, \\npride in its present, and hope and confidence for a bright future. \\nwe expect that our government , based on  its stupendous work , \\nwill be blessed ag ain by the people with a resounding mandate.  \\ninclusive development and growth  \\n5. our humane and inclusive approach to development is a \\nmarked and deliberate departure from the earlier approach of \\n‘provisioning up -to-village level’. development programmes , in \\nthe last ten years, have targeted each and every household and \\nindividual, through ‘housing for all’, ‘har ghar jal’ , electricity for 3 \\n all, cooking gas for all, bank accounts and financial services for \\nall, in record time.  \\n6. the worries about food have been eliminated through free \\nration for 80 crore people. minimum support prices for the \\nproduce of ‘annadata’    are periodically increased appropriately. \\nthese and the provision of basic necessities have enhanced real \\nincome in the rural areas. their econo mic needs could be \\naddressed, thus spurring growth and generating jobs.   \\nsocial justice   \\n7. our government  is working with an approach to \\ndevelopment that is  all-round, all -pervasive and all -inclusive \\n(सर्वांगीण , सर्वस्पर्शी  और सर्वसमवर्ेर्शी ). it covers all castes and \\npeople at all levels. we are working to make india a ‘viksit \\nbharat’ by 2047. for achieving that goal, we need to improve \\npeople’s capability and empower them.  \\n8. previously, social justice was mostly a political slogan. for \\nour gov ernment, social justice is an effective and necessary \\ngovernance model. the saturation approach of covering all \\neligible people is the true and comprehensive achievement of \\nsocial justice. this is secularism in action, reduces corruption, \\nand prevents nepo tism (भवई-भतीजवर्वद ). there is transparency \\nand assurance that benefits are delivered to all eligible people.  \\nthe resources are distributed fairly . all, regardless of their social \\nstanding, get access to opportunities. we are addressing \\nsystemic inequaliti es that had plagued our society. we focus on 4 \\n outcomes and not on outlays so that the socio -economic \\ntransformation is achieved.   \\n9. as our prime minister firmly believes , we need to focus on \\nfour major castes. they are, ‘garib’ (poor) , ‘mahilayen’ \\n(women),  ‘yuva’  (youth) and   ‘annadata’ (farmer). their needs, \\ntheir aspirations, and their welfare are our highest priority. the \\ncountry progresses, when they progress. all four require and \\nreceive government support in their quest to better their lives. \\ntheir empo werment and well -being will drive the country \\nforward.  \\ngarib kalyan, desh ka kalyan  \\n10. we believe in empowering the poor. the earlier approach \\nof tackling poverty through entitlements had resulted in very \\nmodest outcomes. when the poor become empowered partners \\nin the development process, government’s power to assist them \\nalso increases mani fold. with the pursuit of ‘sabka ka saath’  in \\nthese 10 years , the government has assisted 25 crore people to \\nget freedom from multi -dimensional poverty. our government’s \\nefforts are now getting synergized with energy and passion of \\nsuch empowered people. t his is truly elevating them from \\npoverty.   \\n11. ‘direct benefit transfer’ of ` 34 lakh crore from the \\ngovernment using pm -jan dhan accounts has led to savings of  \\n` 2.7 lakh crore  for the government . this has been realized 5 \\n through avoidance of leakages prevale nt earlier. the savings \\nhave helped in providing more funds for ‘garib kalyan’.  \\n12. pm-svanidhi has provide d credit assistance to 78 lakh \\nstreet vendors.  from that total, 2.3 lakh have received credit for \\nthe third time.  \\n13. pm-janman yojana reaches out to the particularly \\nvulnerable tribal groups, who have remained outside  the realm \\nof development so far. pm -vishwakarma yojana provides end -to-\\nend support to artisans and craftspeople engaged in 18 trades. \\nthe schemes for empowerment of divyangs and transgender \\nperson s reflect firm resolve of our  government to leave no one \\nbehind.  \\nwelfare of annadata  \\n14. farmers are our ‘annadata’ . every year, under pm -kisan \\nsamman yojana, direct financial assistance is provided to  \\n11.8 crore farmers, including marginal and small farmers.  crop \\ninsurance is given to  4 crore farmers under pm fasal bima \\nyojana. these, besides several other programmes, are assisting \\n‘annadata’  in producing food for the country and the world.  \\n15. electroni c national agriculture market has integrated  \\n1361 mandis, and is providing services to 1.8 crore farmers with \\ntrading volume of ` 3 lakh crore.  \\n16. the sector is poised for inclusive, balanced, higher growth \\nand productivity. these are facilitated from farme r-centric \\npolicies, income support, coverage of risks through price and 6 \\n insurance support, promotion of technologies and innovations \\nthrough start -ups.  \\nempowering  amrit peed hi, the yuva  \\n17. our prosperity depends on adequately equipping and \\nempowering the youth. the national education policy 2020 is \\nushering in transformational reforms. pm schools for rising india \\n(pm shri) are delivering quality teaching, and nurturing holistic \\nand well -roun ded individuals.  \\n18. the skill india mission has trained 1.4 crore youth, \\nupskilled and reskilled 54 lakh youth, and established 3000 new \\nitis. a large number of new institutions of higher learning, \\nnamely 7 iits, 16 iiits, 7 iims, 15 aiims and 390 universiti es have \\nbeen set up.   \\n19. pm mudra yojana has sanctioned 43 crore loans \\naggregating to ` 22.5 lakh crore for entrepreneurial aspirations \\nof our youth. besides that, fund of funds, start up india, and \\nstart up credit guarantee schemes are assisting our youth. they \\nare also becoming ‘rozgardata’.  \\n20. the country is proud of our youth scaling new heights in \\nsports. the highest ever medal tally in asian games and asian \\npara games in 2023 reflects a high confidence level. chess \\nprodigy and our number -one ranked player  praggnanandhaa put \\nup a stiff fight against the reigning world champion magnus \\ncarlsson in 2023. today, india has over 80 chess grandmasters \\ncompared to little over 20 in 2010.  7 \\n momentum for nari shakti  \\n21. the empowerment of women through entrepreneurship, \\nease of living, and dignity for them has gained momentum in \\nthese ten years.  \\n22. thirty crore mudra yojana loans have been given to \\nwomen entrepreneurs. female enrolment in higher education \\nhas gone up by twenty -eight per cent in ten years. in stem \\ncourses, gir ls and women constitute forty -three per cent of \\nenrolment - one of the highest in the world. all these measures \\nare getting reflected in the increasing participation of women in \\nworkforce . \\n23. making ‘triple talaq’ illegal, reservation of one -third seats \\nfor w omen in the lok sabha and state legislative assemblies, and \\ngiving over seventy per cent houses under pm awas yojana in \\nrural areas to women as sole or joint owners have enhanced \\ntheir dignity.  \\nexemplary  track record of governance, development and \\nperformance (gdp)  \\n24. besides delivering on high growth in terms of gross \\ndomestic product, the government is equally focused on a more \\ncomprehensive ‘gdp’ , i.e ., ’governance, development and \\nperformance’ .   \\n25. our g overnment has provided transparent, accountable, \\npeople -centric and prompt trust -based administration with 8 \\n ‘citizen -first’ and ‘minimum government, maximum governance’ \\napproach.  \\n26. the impact of all -round development is discernible in all \\nsectors. there is mac ro-economic stability, including in the \\nexternal sector. investments are robust. the economy is doing \\nwell.  \\n27. people are living better and earning better, with even \\ngreater aspirations for the future. average real income of the \\npeople has increased by fifty  per cent. inflation is moderate. \\npeople are getting empowered, equipped and enabled to pursue \\ntheir aspirations. there is effective and timely delivery of \\nprogrammes and of large projects.  \\neconomic management  \\n28. the multipronged economic management over the  past \\nten years has complemented people -centric inclusive \\ndevelopment. following are some of the major elements.   \\n(1) all forms of infrastructure , physical, digital or social, \\nare being built in record time.   \\n(2) all parts of the country are becoming active \\nparticipants in economic  growth.  \\n(3) digital public infrastructure, a new ‘factor of \\nproduction ’ in the 21st century, is instrumental in \\nformalization of the economy.      9 \\n (4) goods and services tax has enabled ‘one nation, \\none market, one tax’ . tax reforms have led to \\ndeepening  and widening of tax base.  \\n(5) strengthening of the financial sector has helped in \\nmaking savings, credit and investments more \\nefficient.   \\n(6) gift ifsc and the unified regulatory authority, ifsca \\nare creating a robust gateway for global capital and \\nfinancial services for the economy.  \\n(7) proactive inflation management has helped keep  \\ninflation within  the policy band.   \\nglobal context  \\n29. geopolitically , global affairs are becoming more complex \\nand challenging with wars and conflicts. globalization is being \\nredefined with reshoring and friend -shoring, disruption and \\nfragmentation of supply chains, and competition for critical \\nminerals and technologies. a  new world order is emerging after \\nthe covid pandemic.  \\n30. india assumed g20  presidency during very difficult times \\nfor the world. the global economy was going through high \\ninflation, high interest rates, low growth, very high public debt, \\nlow trade growth, and climate challenges. the pandemic had led \\nto a crisis of food, fertiliz er, fuel and finances for the world, while \\nindia successfully  navigated its way. the country showed the way 10 \\n forward and built consensus on solutions for those global \\nproblems.  \\n31. the recently announced india -middle east -europe

primary and secondary processing and \\nmarketing and branding.  \\n \\n 15 \\n nano dap  \\n52. after the successful adoption of nano urea, application of \\nnano dap on various crops will be expanded in all agro -climatic \\nzones.   \\natmanirbhar  oil seeds abhiyan  \\n53. building on the initiative announced in 2022, a strategy \\nwill be formulated to achieve ‘atmanirbharta’  for oil seeds such \\nas mustard, groundnut, sesame, soybean, and sunflower. this \\nwill cover research for high -yielding varieties, widesp read \\nadoption of modern farming techniques, market linkages, \\nprocurement, value addition, and crop insurance.      \\ndairy development  \\n54. a comprehensive programme for  supporting dairy farmers \\nwill be formulated. efforts are already on to control foot and \\nmouth  disease. india is the world’s largest milk producer but \\nwith low productivity of milch -animals. the programme will be \\nbuilt on the success of existing schemes such rashtriya gokul \\nmission, national livestock mission, and infrastructure \\ndevelopment funds f or dairy processing and animal husbandry.   \\nmatsya sampada  \\n55. it was our government which set up a separate \\ndepartment for fisheries realizing the importance of assisting \\nfishermen. this has resulted in doubling of both inland and \\naquaculture production. seaf ood export since 2013 -14 has also 16 \\n doubled.  implementation of pradhan mantri matsya sampada \\nyojana (pmmsy) will be stepped up to:  \\n(1) enhance aquaculture productivity from existing 3 to  \\n5 tons per hectare,

didi already. they \\nare an inspiration to others. their achievements will be \\nrecognized through honouring them. buoyed by the success, it \\nhas been decided to enhance the target for lakhpati didi from  \\n2 crore to 3 crore.  \\ntechnological changes  \\n57. new age technologies  and data  are changing the lives of \\npeople and businesses. the y are also enabling new economic \\nopportunities and facilitating provision of high -quality services at \\naffordable prices for all, inc luding those at ‘bottom of the \\npyramid’. opportunities for india at the global level are 17 \\n expanding. india is showing solutions through innovation and \\nentrepreneurship of its people.  \\nresearch and innovation for catalyzing growth, employment \\nand development  \\n58. prime minister shastri gave the slogan of “jai jawan jai \\nkisan”. prime minister vajpayee made that “jai jawan jai kisan \\njai vigyan”. prime minister modi has furthered that to “jai \\njawan jai kisan jai vigyan and jai anusandhan” , as innovation is \\nthe founda tion of development.  \\n59. for our tech savvy youth, this will be a golden era.  \\na corpus of rupees  one lakh crore will be established with  \\nfifty-year interest free loan . the corpus will provide long -term \\nfinancing or refinancing with long tenors and low or nil interest \\nrates. this will encourage the private sector  to scale up research \\nand innovation significantly in sunrise domains. we need to have \\nprogrammes that combin e the powers of our youth and \\ntechnology.  \\n60. a new scheme will be launched for strengthening  \\ndeep -tech technologies for defence purposes and expediting \\n‘atmanirbharta’ .    \\ninfrastructure development  \\n61. building on the massive tripling of the capital expenditure  \\noutlay in the past 4 years resulting in huge multiplier impact on \\neconomic growth and employment creation, the outlay for the \\nnext year is being increased by 11.1 per cent to eleven lakh, 18 \\n eleven thousand, one hundred and eleven crore rupees  \\n(` 11,11,111 crore). this would be 3.4 per cent of the gdp.  \\nrailways  \\n62. three major economic railway corridor programmes will \\nbe implemented. these are : \\n(1) energy, mineral and cement corridors,  \\n(2) port connectivity corridors, and  \\n(3) high traffic density corridors.  \\nthe projects have been identified under the pm gati shakti for \\nenabling multi -modal connectivity. they will improve logistics \\nefficiency and reduce cost.  \\n63.   the resultant decongestion of the high -traffic corridors \\nwill also help in improving operations of passenger trains, \\nresulting in safety and higher travel speed for passengers. \\ntogether with dedicated freight corridors, these three economic \\ncorridor programmes will accelerate our gdp growth and reduce \\nlogistic costs.   \\n64. forty thousand normal rail bogies will be converted to the \\nvande bharat standards to enhance safety , convenience and \\ncomfort  of passengers.   \\naviation sector  \\n65. the aviation sector has been galvanized in the past  \\nten years. number of airports have  doubled to 149. roll out of \\nair connectivity to tier -two and tier -three cities under udan 19 \\n scheme has been widespread.  five hundred and seventeen new \\nroutes are carrying 1.3 crore passengers. indian carriers have  \\npro-actively plac ed orders for over 1000 n ew aircrafts. expansion \\nof existing airports and development of new airports will \\ncontinue expeditiously.  \\nmetro and namo bharat  \\n66. we have a fast -expanding middle class and rapid \\nurbanization is taking place.  metro rail and namo bharat can be \\nthe catalyst f or the required urban transformation. expansion of \\nthese systems will be supported in large cities focusing on \\ntransit -oriented development.  \\ngreen energy  \\n67. towards meeting our commitment for ‘net -zero’ by 2070, \\nthe following measures will be taken.  \\na. viabilit y gap funding will be provided for harnessing \\noffshore wind energy potential for initial capacity of \\none giga -watt.  \\nb. coal gasification and liquefaction capacity of 100 mt \\nwill be set up by 2030. this will also help in reducing \\nimports of natural gas, methanol, and ammonia.   \\nc. phased mandatory blending of compressed biogas  \\n(cbg)  in compressed natural gas (cng) for transport \\nand piped natural gas  (png)  for domestic purposes will \\nbe mandated.  20 \\n d. financial  assistance will be provided for procurement \\nof biomass aggregation machinery to support \\ncollection . \\nelectric vehicle eco system  \\n68. our government will expand and strengthen the e -vehicle \\necosystem  by supporting manufacturing and charging \\ninfrastructure. greater adoption of e -buses for public transport \\nnetworks will be encouraged through payment security \\nmechanism.  \\nbio-manufacturing and bio -foundry  \\n69. for promotin g green growth, a new scheme of  \\nbio-manufacturing and bio -foundry will be launched. this will \\nprovide environment friendly alternatives such as biodegradable \\npolymers, bio -plastics, bio -pharmaceuticals and bio -agri-inputs.  \\nthis scheme will also help in transforming today’s consumptive \\nmanufacturing paradigm to the one based on regenerative \\nprinciples.  \\nblue economy 2.0  \\n70. for promoting climate resilient activities for blue economy \\n2.0, a scheme for restoration and adaptation measures, and \\ncoastal aquaculture and mariculture with integrated a nd  \\nmulti -sectoral approach will be launched.  \\n \\n 21 \\n comprehensive development of tourist centres  \\n71. the success of organizing g20 meetings in sixty places \\npresented diversity of india to global audience. our economic \\nstrength has made the country an attractive de stination for \\nbusiness and conference tourism. our middle class also now \\naspires to travel and explore. tourism,

provided to states for financin g such \\ndevelopment on matching basis.  \\n73. to address the emerging fervour for domestic tourism, \\nprojects for port connectivity, tourism infrastructure, and \\namenities will be taken up on our islands, including \\nlakshadweep. this will help in generating employmen t also.  \\npromoting investments  \\n74. the fdi inflow during 2014 -23 was usd 596 billion marking \\na golden era .  that is twice the inflow during 2005 -14.   \\nfor encouraging sustained foreign investment, we are \\nnegotiating bilateral investment treaties with our foreig n \\npartners, in the spirit of ‘first develop india’.  \\n 22 \\n reforms in the states for ‘ viksit bharat’  \\n75. many growth and development enabling reforms are \\nneeded in the states for realizing the vision of ‘viksit bharat’.  \\na provision of seventy -five thousand crore rupees as fifty-year \\ninterest free loan is proposed this year to support those \\nmilestone -linked reforms by the state governments.    \\nsocietal changes  \\n76. the government will form a high -powered committee for \\nan extensive consideration of the challenges arising from fast \\npopulation growth and demographic changes.  the committee \\nwill be mandated to make recommendations for addressing \\nthese challenges comprehensively in relation to the goal of \\n‘viksit bharat’.  \\namrit kaal as kartavya kaal  \\n77. our g overnment stands committed to strengthening and \\nexpanding the economy with high growth and to create \\nconditions for people to realize their aspirations.  hon’ble prime \\nminister in his independence day address to the nation, in the \\n75th year of our republic  said; we “commit ourselves to national \\ndevelopment, with new inspirations, new consciousness, new \\nresolutions, as the country opens up immense possibilities and \\nopportunities” . it is our ‘kartavya kaal’.  \\n78. every challenge of the pre-2014  era was overcome \\nthrough our economic management and our governance. these \\nhave placed the country on a resolute path of sustained high 23 \\n growth.  this has been possible through our right policies, true \\nintentions, and appropriate decisions. in the full budget in july, \\nour government will present a detailed roadmap for our pursuit \\nof ‘viksit bharat’ .  \\nrevised estimates 2023 -24 \\n79. the revised estimate of the total receipts other than \\nborrowings is ` 27.56  lakh crore, of which the tax receipts are  \\n` 23.24  lakh crore. the revised estimate of the total expenditure \\nis ` 44.90  lakh crore.      \\n80. the revenue receipts at ` 30.03  lakh crore are expected to \\nbe higher than the budget estimate, reflecting strong growth \\nmomentum and formalization in the economy.  \\n81. the r evised estimate of the fiscal deficit is 5.8 per cent of \\ngdp, improving on the budget estimate, notwithstanding \\nmoderation in the nominal growth estimates.        \\nbudget estimates 2024 -25 \\n82. coming to 2024 -25, the total receipts other than \\nborrowings and the total expenditure are estimated at ` 30.80  \\nand 47.66  lakh crore respectively. the tax receipts are estimated \\nat ` 26.02  lakh crore.     \\n83. the scheme of fifty-year interest free loan for capital \\nexpenditure to states will be continued this year with total out lay \\nof  ` 1.3 lakh crore.   24 \\n 84. we continue on the path of fiscal consolidation, as \\nannounced in my budget speech for 2021 -22, to reduce fiscal \\ndeficit below 4.5 per cent by 2025 -26. the fiscal deficit in  \\n2024 -25 is estimated to be 5.1 per cent of gdp, adhering to that \\npath.  \\n85.  the gross and net market borrowings through  dated \\nsecurities during 2024 -25 are estimated at ` 14.13  and  \\n11.75  lakh crore respectively. both will be less than that in  \\n2023 -24. now that the private investments ar e happening at \\nscale, the lower borrowings by the central government will \\nfacilitate larger availability of credit for the private sector.   \\nvote on account  \\n86. i will be seeking ‘vote on account’ approval of the \\nparliament through the appropriation bill for a part of the \\nfinancial year  2024 -25.    \\ni will, now, move to part b.  \\n  25 \\n part b  \\nhon’ble speaker sir,  \\ndirect taxes  \\n87. over the last ten years, the direct tax collections have \\nmore than trebled and the return filers swelled to 2.4 times.  \\ni would like to assure the taxpayers that their contributions have \\nbeen used wisely for the development of the country and \\nwelfare of its people. i appreciate the tax payers for their \\nsupport.  \\n88. the government has reduced and rationalized tax rates. \\nunder the new tax scheme, there  is now no tax liability for tax \\npayers with income up to ₹ 7 lakh, up from ₹ 2.2 lakh in the \\nfinancial year 2013 -14. the threshold for presumptive taxation \\nfor retail businesses was increased from ₹ 2 crore to ₹ 3 crore. \\nsimilarly, the threshold for professionals eligible for presumptive \\ntaxation was increased from ₹ 50 lakh to  ₹ 75 lakh.  also, \\ncorporate tax rate was decreased from 30 per cent to 22 per cent \\nfor existing domestic companies and to 15 per cent for certain \\nnew manufacturing companies.  \\n89. in the last five years, our focus has been to improve  \\ntax-payer services. the age -old jurisdiction -based assessment \\nsystem was transformed with the introduction of faceless \\nassessment and appeal, thereby imparting greater efficiency, \\ntransparency and accoun tability. introduction of updated income \\ntax returns, a new form 26as and prefilling of tax returns have 26 \\n made filing of tax returns simpler and easier. average processing \\ntime of returns has been reduced from 93 days in the year  \\n2013 -14 to a mere ten days  this year, thereby making refunds \\nfaster.  \\nindirect taxes   \\n90. by unifying the highly fragmented indirect tax regime in \\nindia, gst has reduced the compliance burden on trade and \\nindustry. the industry has acknowledged the benefits of gst. \\naccording to a recen t survey conducted by a leading consulting \\nfirm, 94  per cent  of industry leaders view the transition to gst as \\nlargely positive. according to 80  per cent  of the respondents, it \\nhas led to supply chain optimisation, as elimination of tax \\narbitrage and octro i has resulted in disbanding of check posts at \\nstate and city boundaries. at the same time, tax base of gst \\nmore than doubled and the average monthly gross gst \\ncollection has almost doubled to ₹ 1.66 lakh crore, this year.  \\nstates too have benefited. states ’ sgst revenue, including \\ncompensation released to states, in the post -gst period of  \\n2017 -18 to 2022 -23, has achieved a buoyancy of 1.22. in \\ncontrast, the tax buoyancy of state revenues from subsumed \\ntaxes in the pre -gst four -year period of 2012 -13 to 201 5-16 was \\na mere 0.72. the biggest beneficiaries are the consumers, as \\nreduction in logistics costs and taxes have brought down prices \\nof most goods and services.  27 \\n 91. we have taken a number of steps in customs to facilitate \\ninternational trade. as a result, the  import release time declined \\nby 47  per cent to 71 hours at inland container depots, by 28  per \\ncent  to 44 hours at air cargo complexes and by 27  per cent  to  \\n85 hours at sea ports, over the last four years since 2019, when \\nthe national time release studies  were first started.  \\ntax proposals  \\n92. as for tax proposals, in keeping with the convention, i do \\nnot propose to make any changes relating to taxation and \\npropose to retain the same tax rates for direct taxes and indirect \\ntaxes including import duties. however , certain tax benefits to \\nstart -ups and investments made by sovereign wealth or pension \\nfunds as also tax exemption on certain income of some ifsc units \\nare expiring on 31.03.2024. to provide continuity in taxation,  \\ni propose to extend the date to 31.03.2 025.  \\n93. moreover, in line with  our government’s vision to improve \\nease of living and ease of doing business, i wish to make an \\nannouncement to improve tax payer services. there are a large \\nnumber of petty, non -verified, non -reconciled or disputed direct \\ntax d emands, many of them dating as far back as the year 1962, \\nwhich continue to remain on the books, causing anxiety to \\nhonest tax payers and hindering refunds of subsequent years.  \\ni propose to withdraw such outstanding direct tax demands up \\nto twenty -five th ousand rupees ( ₹ 25,000 ) pertaining to the \\nperiod up to financial year 2009 -10 and up to ten-thousand 28 \\n rupees ( ₹ 10,000 ) for financial years 2010 -11 to 2014 -15. this is \\nexpected to benefit about a crore tax-payers.  \\neconomy – then and now  \\n94. in 2014 when our government assumed the reins, the \\nresponsibility to mend the economy step by step and to put the \\ngovernance systems in order was enormous. the need of the \\nhour was to give hope to the people, to attract investments, and \\nto build support for the much -needed reforms. the government \\ndid that successfully following our strong belief of ‘nation -first’.   \\n95. the crisis of those years has been overcome, and the \\neconomy has been put firmly on a high sustainable growth path \\nwith all -round development. it is now appropri ate to look at \\nwhere we were then till 2014 and where we are now, only for \\nthe purpose of drawing lessons from the mismanagement of \\nthose years. the government will lay a white paper on table of \\nthe house.  \\n96. the exemplary track record of governance, develop ment \\nand performance , effective delivery , and ‘jan kalyan ’ has given \\nthe government trust, confidence and blessings of the people to \\nrealize, whatever it takes, the goal of ‘viksit bharat’ with good \\nintentions, true dedication and hard work in the coming y ears \\nand decades .   \\n97. with this, i commend the interim budget to this august \\nhouse.  \\njai hind.  \\ngovernment of india\\nbudget

sitharaman \\nminister of finance \\nfebruary 1, 2023 \\nhon’ble speaker,  \\n i present the budget for 2023-24. this is the first budget in amrit \\nkaal . \\nintroduction \\n1. this budget hopes to build on the foundation laid in the previous \\nbudget, and the blueprint drawn for india@100. we envision a prosperous \\nand inclusive india, in which the fruits of development reach all regions and \\ncitizens, especially our youth, women, farmers, obcs, scheduled castes and \\nscheduled tribes.  \\n2. in the 75th year of our independence, the world has recognised the \\nindian economy as a ‘bright star’. our current year’s economic growth is \\nestimated to be at 7 per cent. it is notable that this is the highest among all \\nthe major economies. this is in spite of the massive slowdown globally \\ncaused by covid-19 and a war. the indian economy is therefore on the right \\ntrack, and despite a time of challenges, heading towards a bright future.  \\n3. today as indians stands with their head held high, and the world \\nappreciates india’s achievements and successes, we are sure that elders \\nwho had fought for india’s independence, will with joy, bless us our \\nendeavors going forward. \\nresilience amidst multiple crises \\n4. our focus on wide-ranging reforms and sound policies, implemented \\nthrough sabka prayas  resulting in jan bhagidari  and targeted support to \\nthose in need, helped us perform well in trying times. india’s rising global 2 \\n \\n \\n profile is because of several accomplishments: unique world class digital \\npublic infrastructure, e.g., aadhaar, co-win and upi; covid vaccination drive \\nin unparalleled scale and speed; proactive role in frontier areas such as \\nachieving the climate related goals, mission life, and national hydrogen \\nmission.  \\n5. during the covid-19 pandemic, we ensured that no one goes to bed \\nhungry, with a scheme to supply free food grains to over 80 crore persons \\nfor 28 months. continuing our commitment to ensure food and nutritional \\nsecurity, we are implementing, from 1st january 2023, a scheme to supply \\nfree food grain to all antyodaya and priority households for the next one \\nyear, under pm garib kalyan anna yojana (pmgkay). the entire \\nexpenditure of about ` 2 lakh crore will be borne by the central \\ngovernment. \\ng20 presidency: steering the global agenda through challenges \\n6. in these times of global challenges, the g20 presidency gives us a \\nunique opportunity to strengthen india’s role in the world economic order. \\nwith the theme of ‘ vasudhaiva kutumbakam’ , we are steering an \\nambitious, people-centric agenda to address global challenges, and to \\nfacilitate sustainable economic development.  \\nachievements since 2014: leaving no one behind \\n7. the government’s efforts since 2014 have ensured for all citizens a \\nbetter quality of living and a life of dignity. the per capita income has more \\nthan doubled to ` 1.97 lakh.   \\n8. in these nine years, the indian economy has increased in size from \\nbeing 10th to 5th largest in the world. we have significantly improved our \\nposition as a well-governed and innovative country with a conducive \\nenvironment for business as reflected in several global indices. we have \\nmade significant progress in many sustainable development goals.  3 \\n \\n \\n 9. the economy has become a lot more formalised as reflected in the \\nepfo membership more than doubling to 27 crore, and 7,400 crore digital \\npayments of ` 126 lakh crore through upi in 2022.    \\n10. the efficient implementation of many schemes, with \\nuniversalisation of targeted benefits, has resulted in inclusive development. \\nsome of the schemes are: \\ni. 11.7 crore household toilets under swachh bharat mission,  \\nii. 9.6 crore lpg connections under ujjawala,  \\niii. 220 crore covid vaccination of 102 crore persons,    \\niv. 47.8 crore pm jan dhan bank accounts, \\nv. insurance cover for 44.6 crore persons under pm suraksha \\nbima and pm jeevan jyoti yojana, and \\nvi. cash transfer of ` 2.2 lakh crore to over 11.4 crore farmers \\nunder pm kisan samman nidhi. \\nvision for amrit kaal  – an empowered and inclusive economy \\n11. our vision for the amrit kaal  includes technology-driven and \\nknowledge-based economy with strong public finances, and a robust \\nfinancial sector. to achieve this, jan bhagidari through sabka saath sabka \\nprayas  is essential.   \\n12. the economic agenda for achieving this vision focuses on three \\nthings: first, facilitating ample opportunities for citizens, especially the \\nyouth, to fulfil their aspirations; second, providing strong impetus to growth \\nand job creation; and third, strengthening macro-economic stability.    \\n13. to service these focus areas in our journey to india@100, we believe \\nthat the following four opportunities can be transformative during amrit \\nkaal.  4 \\n \\n \\n 1) economic empowerment of women : deendayal antyodaya yojana \\nnational rural livelihood mission has achieved remarkable success \\nby mobilizing rural women into 81 lakh self help groups. we will \\nenable these groups to reach the next stage of economic \\nempowerment through formation of large producer enterprises or \\ncollectives with each having several thousand members and \\nmanaged professionally. they will be helped with supply of raw \\nmaterials and for better design, quality, branding and marketing of \\ntheir products. through supporting policies, they will be enabled to \\nscale up their operations to serve the large consumer markets, as \\nhas been the case with several start-ups growing into ‘unicorns’. \\n2) pm vishwakarma kaushal samman (pm vikas) : for centuries, \\ntraditional artisans and craftspeople, who work with their hands \\nusing tools, have brought renown for india. they are generally \\nreferred to as vishwakarma. the art and handicraft created by them \\nrepresents the true spirit of atmanirbhar bharat. for the first time, a \\npackage of assistance for them has been conceptualized. the new \\nscheme will enable them to improve the quality, scale and reach of \\ntheir products, integrating them with the msme value chain. the \\ncomponents of the scheme will include not only financial support \\nbut also access to advanced skill training, knowledge of modern \\ndigital techniques and efficient green technologies, brand \\npromotion, linkage with local and global markets, digital payments, \\nand social security. this will greatly benefit the scheduled castes, \\nscheduled tribes, obcs, women and people belonging to the weaker \\nsections.  \\n3) tourism : the country offers immense attraction for domestic as well \\nas foreign tourists. there is a large potential to be tapped in tourism. \\nthe sector holds huge opportunities for jobs and entrepreneurship \\nfor youth in particular.  promotion of tourism will be taken up on \\nmission mode, with active participation of states, convergence of \\ngovernment programmes and public-private partnerships. 5 \\n \\n \\n 4) green growth: we are implementing many programmes for green \\nfuel, green energy, green farming, green mobility, green buildings, \\nand green equipment, and policies for efficient use of energy across \\nvarious economic sectors. these green growth efforts help in \\nreducing carbon intensity of the economy and provides for large-\\nscale green job opportunities.  \\npriorities of this budget  \\n14. the budget adopts the following seven priorities. they

\\nfiscal management \\nfifty-year interest free loan to states \\n111. the entire fifty-year loan to states has to be spent on capital \\nexpenditure within 2023-24. most of this will be at the discretion of states, \\nbut a part will be conditional on states increasing their actual capital 25 \\n \\n \\n expenditure. parts of the outlay will also be linked to, or allocated for, the \\nfollowing purposes: \\n\\uf0b7 scrapping old government vehicles, \\n\\uf0b7 urban planning reforms and actions, \\n\\uf0b7 financing reforms in urban local bodies to make them \\ncreditworthy for

\\n0.5 per cent will be tied to power sector reforms.  \\nrevised estimates 2022-23 \\n113. the revised estimate of the total receipts other than borrowings is  \\n` 24.3 lakh crore, of which the net tax receipts  \\nare ` 20.9 lakh crore. the revised estimate of the total expenditure is  \\n` 41.9 lakh crore, of which the capital expenditure is about ` 7.3 lakh crore.      \\n114. the revised estimate of the fiscal deficit is 6.4 per cent of gdp, \\nadhering to the budget estimate.        \\nbudget estimates 2023-24 \\n115. coming to 2023-24, the total receipts other than borrowings and the \\ntotal expenditure are estimated at ` 27.2 lakh crore and ` 45 lakh crore \\nrespectively. the net tax receipts are estimated at ` 23.3 lakh crore.      26 \\n \\n \\n 116. the fiscal deficit is estimated to be 5.9 per cent of gdp. in my \\nbudget speech for 2021-22, i had announced that we plan to continue the \\npath of fiscal consolidation, reaching a fiscal deficit below 4.5 per cent by \\n2025-26 with a fairly steady decline over the period. we have adhered to \\nthis path, and i reiterate my intention to bring the fiscal deficit below 4.5 \\nper cent of gdp by 2025-26.  \\n117.  to finance the fiscal deficit in 2023-24, the net market borrowings \\nfrom dated securities are estimated at ` 11.8 lakh crore. the balance \\nfinancing is expected to come from small savings and other sources. the \\ngross market borrowings are estimated at ` 15.4 lakh crore. \\ni will, now, move to part b. \\n \\n \\n  27 \\n \\n \\n part b \\nindirect taxes \\n118. my indirect tax proposals aim to promote exports, boost domestic \\nmanufacturing, enhance domestic value addition, encourage green energy \\nand mobility.  \\n119. a simplified tax structure with fewer tax rates helps in reducing \\ncompliance burden and improving tax administration. i propose to reduce \\nthe number of basic customs duty rates on goods, other than textiles and \\nagriculture, from 21 to 13. as a result, there are minor changes in the basic \\ncustom duties, cesses and surcharges on some items including toys, \\nbicycles, automobiles and naphtha. \\n \\ngreen mobility \\n120. to avoid cascading of taxes on blended compressed natural gas, i \\npropose to exempt excise duty on gst-paid compressed bio gas contained \\nin it. to further provide impetus to green mobility, customs duty exemption \\nis being extended to import of capital goods and machinery required for \\nmanufacture of lithium-ion cells for batteries used in electric vehicles. \\nelectronics  \\n121. as a result of various initiatives of the government, including the \\nphased manufacturing programme, mobile phone production in india has \\nincreased from 5.8 crore units valued at about ` 18,900 crore in 2014-15 to \\n31 crore units valued at over ` 2,75,000 crore in the last financial year. to \\nfurther deepen domestic value addition in manufacture of mobile phones, i \\npropose to provide relief in customs duty on import of certain parts and \\ninputs like camera lens and continue the concessional duty on lithium-ion \\ncells for batteries for another year.  28 \\n \\n \\n 122. similarly, to promote value addition in manufacture of televisions, i \\npropose to reduce the basic customs duty on parts of open cells of tv \\npanels to 2.5 per cent.  \\nelectrical  \\n123. to rectify inversion of duty structure and encourage manufacturing \\nof electric kitchen chimneys, the basic customs duty on electric kitchen \\nchimney is being increased from 7.5 per cent to 15 per cent and that on \\nheat coils for these is proposed to be reduced from 20 per cent to 15 per \\ncent. \\nchemicals and petrochemicals  \\n124. denatured ethyl alcohol is used in chemical industry. \\n i propose to exempt basic customs duty on it. this will also support the \\nethanol blending programme and facilitate our endeavour for energy \\ntransition. basic customs duty is also being reduced on acid grade fluorspar \\nfrom 5 per cent to 2.5 per cent to make the domestic fluorochemicals \\nindustry competitive. further, the basic customs duty on crude glycerin for \\nuse in manufacture of epicholorhydrin is proposed to be reduced from 7.5 \\nper cent to 2.5 per cent. \\nmarine products \\n125. in the last financial year, marine products recorded the highest \\nexport growth benefitting farmers in the coastal states of the country. to \\nfurther enhance the export competitiveness of marine products, \\nparticularly shrimps, duty is being reduced on key inputs for domestic \\nmanufacture of shrimp feed. \\nlab grown diamonds \\n126. india is a global leader in cutting and polishing of natural diamonds, \\ncontributing about three-fourths of the global turnover by value. with the \\ndepletion in deposits of natural diamonds, the industry is moving towards \\nlab grown diamonds (lgds) and it holds huge promise. to seize this 29 \\n \\n \\n opportunity, i propose to reduce basic customs duty on seeds used in their \\nmanufacture.  \\n \\nprecious metals \\n127. customs duties on dore and bars of gold and platinum were \\nincreased earlier this fiscal. i now propose to increase the duties on articles \\nmade therefrom to enhance the duty differential. i also propose to increase \\nthe import duty on silver dore, bars and articles to align them with that on \\ngold and platinum. \\nmetals \\n128. to facilitate availability of raw materials for the steel sector, \\nexemption from basic customs duty on raw materials for manufacture of \\ncrgo steel, ferrous scrap and nickel cathode is being continued. \\n129. similarly, the concessional bcd of 2.5 per cent on copper scrap is \\nalso being continued to ensure the availability of raw materials for \\nsecondary copper producers who are mainly in the msme sector. \\ncompounded rubber \\n130. the basic customs duty rate on compounded rubber is being \\nincreased from 10 per cent to ‘25 per cent or ` 30/kg whichever is lower’, at \\npar with that on natural rubber other than latex, to curb circumvention of \\nduty.  \\ncigarettes \\n131. national calamity contingent duty (nccd) on specified cigarettes \\nwas last revised three years ago. this is proposed to be revised upwards by \\nabout 16 per cent. \\n 30 \\n \\n \\n  \\ndirect taxes \\n132. i now come to my direct tax proposals. these proposals aim to \\nmaintain continuity and stability of taxation, further simplify and rationalise \\nvarious provisions to reduce the compliance burden, promote the \\nentrepreneurial spirit and provide tax relief to citizens. \\n133. it has been the constant endeavour of the income tax department \\nto improve tax payers services by making compliance easy and smooth. our \\ntax payers’ portal received a maximum of 72 lakh returns in a day; \\nprocessed more than 6.5 crore returns this year; average processing period \\nreduced from 93 days in financial year 13-14 to 16 days now;  \\nand 45 per cent of the returns were processed within 24 hours. we intend \\nto further improve this, roll out a next-generation common it return form \\nfor tax payer convenience, and also plan to strengthen the grievance \\nredressal mechanism.  \\nmsmes and professionals  \\n134. msmes are growth engines of our economy.  micro enterprises with \\nturnover up to ` 2 crore and certain professionals with turnover of up to  \\n` 50 lakh can avail the benefit of presumptive taxation. i propose to provide \\nenhanced limits of ` 3 crore and ` 75 lakh respectively, to the tax payers \\nwhose cash receipts are no more than 5 per cent. moreover, to support \\nmsmes in timely receipt of payments, i propose to allow deduction for \\nexpenditure incurred on payments made to them only when payment is \\nactually made.  \\ncooperation \\n135. cooperation is a value to be cherished. in realizing our prime \\nminister’s goal of “sahkar se samriddhi ”, and his resolve to “connect the \\nspirit of cooperation with the spirit of amrit kaal”, in addition to the \\nmeasures proposed in part a, i have a slew of proposals for the co-operative \\nsector.  31 \\n \\n \\n 136. first, new co-operatives that commence manufacturing activities till \\n31.3.2024 shall get the benefit of a lower tax rate of 15 per cent, as is \\npresently available to new manufacturing companies. \\n137. secondly, i propose to provide an opportunity to sugar co-operatives \\nto claim payments made to sugarcane farmers for the period prior to \\nassessment year 2016-17 as expenditure. this is expected to provide them \\nwith a relief of almost ` 10,000 crore.  \\n138. thirdly, i am providing a higher limit of ` 2 lakh per member for cash \\ndeposits to and loans in cash by primary agricultural co-operative societies \\n(pacs) and primary co-operative agriculture and rural development banks \\n(pcardbs).  \\n139. similarly, a higher limit of ` 3 crore for tds on cash withdrawal is \\nbeing provided to co-operative societies. \\nstart-ups \\n140. entrepreneurship is vital for a country’s economic development. we \\nhave taken a number of measures for start-ups and they have borne results. \\nindia is now the third largest ecosystem for start-ups globally, and ranks \\nsecond in innovation quality among middle-income countries. i propose to \\nextend the date of incorporation for income tax benefits to start-ups from \\n31.03.23 to 31.3.24. i further propose to provide the benefit of carry \\nforward of losses on change of shareholding of start-ups from seven years \\nof incorporation to ten years. \\nappeals \\n141. to reduce the pendency of appeals at commissioner level, i propose \\nto deploy about 100 joint commissioners for disposal of small appeals. we \\nshall also be more selective in taking up cases for scrutiny of returns already \\nreceived this year. \\n \\n 32 \\n \\n \\n better targeting of tax concessions \\n142. for better targeting of tax concessions and exemptions, \\n i propose to cap deduction from capital gains on investment in residential \\nhouse under sections 54 and 54f to ` 10 crore. another proposal with \\nsimilar intent is to limit income tax exemption from proceeds of insurance \\npolicies with very high value. \\nrationalisation \\n143. there are a number of proposals relating to rationalisation and \\nsimplification. income of authorities, boards and commissions set up by \\nstatutes of the union or state for the purpose of housing, development of \\ncities, towns and villages, and regulating, or regulating and developing an \\nactivity or matter, is proposed to be exempted from income tax. other \\nmajor measures in this direction are: \\n\\uf0b7 removing the minimum threshold of ` 10,000/- for tds and \\nclarifying taxability relating to online gaming; \\n\\uf0b7 not treating conversion of gold into electronic gold receipt and vice \\nversa as capital gain;  \\n\\uf0b7 reducing the tds rate from 30 per cent to 20 per cent on taxable \\nportion of epf withdrawal in non-pan cases; and \\n\\uf0b7 taxation on income from market linked debentures. \\nothers \\n144. other major proposals in the finance bill relate to the following: \\n\\uf0b7 extension of period of tax benefits to funds relocating to ifsc, gift \\ncity till 31.03.2025; \\n\\uf0b7 decriminalisation under section 276a of the income tax act; \\n\\uf0b7 allowing carry forward of losses on strategic disinvestment including \\nthat of idbi bank; and \\n\\uf0b7 providing eee status to agniveer fund. \\n 33 \\n \\n \\n personal income tax \\n145. now, i come to what everyone is waiting for -- personal income tax. i \\nhave five major announcements to make in this regard. these primarily \\nbenefit our hard-working middle class. \\n146. the first one concerns rebate. currently, those with income up to  \\n` 5 lakh do not pay any income tax in both old and new tax regimes. i \\npropose to increase the rebate limit to ` 7 lakh in the new tax regime. thus, \\npersons in the new tax regime, with income up to ` 7 lakh will not have to \\npay any tax.  \\n147. the second proposal relates to middle-class individuals. \\n i had introduced, in the year 2020, the new personal income tax regime \\nwith six income slabs starting from ` 2.5 lakh. i propose to change the tax \\nstructure in this regime by reducing the number of slabs to five and \\nincreasing the tax exemption limit to ` 3 lakh. the new tax rates are: \\n` 0-3 lakh nil \\n` 3-6 lakh 5 per cent \\n` 6-9 lakh 10 per cent \\n` 9-12 lakh 15 per cent \\n` 12-15 lakh 20 per cent \\nabove ` 15 lakh 30 per cent \\n \\n148. this will provide major relief to all tax payers in the new regime. an \\nindividual with an annual income of ` 9 lakh will be required to pay only  \\n` 45,000/-. this is only 5 per cent of his or her income. it is a reduction of 25 \\nper cent on what he or she is required to pay now, ie, ` 60,000/-. similarly, \\nan individual with an income of ` 15 lakh would be required to pay only  \\n` 1.5 lakh or 10 per cent of his or her income, a reduction of 20 per cent \\nfrom the existing liability of ` 1,87,500/.  \\n149. my third proposal is for the salaried class and the pensioners \\nincluding family pensioners, for whom i propose to extend the benefit of 34 \\n \\n \\n standard deduction to the new tax regime. each salaried person with an \\nincome of ` 15.5 lakh or more will thus stand to benefit by ` 52,500. \\n150. my fourth announcement in personal income tax is regarding the \\nhighest tax rate which in our country is 42.74 per cent. this is among the \\nhighest in the world. i propose to reduce the highest surcharge rate from 37 \\nper cent to 25 per cent in the new tax regime. this would result in reduction \\nof the maximum tax rate to 39 per cent. \\n151. lastly, the limit of ` 3 lakh for tax exemption on leave encashment \\non retirement of non-government salaried employees was last fixed in the \\nyear 2002, when the highest basic pay in the government was ` 30,000/- \\npm. in line with the increase in government salaries, i am proposing to \\nincrease this limit to ` 25 lakh. \\n152. we are also making the new income tax regime as the default tax \\nregime. however, citizens will continue to have the option to avail the \\nbenefit of the old tax regime. \\n153. apart from these, i am also making some other changes as given in \\nthe annexure. \\n154. as a result of these proposals, revenue of about ` 38,000 crore –  \\n` 37,000 crore in direct taxes and ` 1,000 crore in indirect taxes – will be \\nforgone while revenue of about ` 3,000 crore will be additionally mobilized. \\nthus, the total revenue forgone is about ` 35,000 crore annually. \\n155. mr. speaker sir, with these words, i commend the budget to this \\naugust house. \\n***** \\n  35 \\n \\n \\n annexure to part b of the budget speech 2023-24 \\namendments relating to direct taxes \\na. providing tax relief  under new personal t ax regime  \\na.1     the new tax regime for individual and huf , introduced by the \\nfinance act 2020, is now proposed to be the default regime.  \\na.2      this regime would also become the default regime for aop (other \\nthan co-operative), boi and ajp.  \\na.3      any individual, huf, aop (other than co-operative), boi or ajp not \\nwilling to be taxed under this new regime can opt to be taxed \\nunder the old regime. for those person having income under the \\nhead “profit and gains of business or profession” and having opted \\nfor old regime can revoke that option only once and after that \\nthey will continue to be taxed under the new regime. for those \\nnot having income under the head “profit and gains of business or \\nprofession”, option for old regime may be exercised in each year. \\na.4      substantial relief is proposed under the new regime with new slabs \\nand tax rates as under: \\ntotal income ( `) rate (per cent)  \\nupto 3,00,000  nil \\nfrom 3,00,001 to 6,00,000  5 \\nfrom 6,00,001 to 9,00,000  10 \\nfrom 9,00,001 to 12,00,000 15 \\nfrom 12,00,001 to 15,00,000  20 \\nabove 15,00,000  30 \\n \\na.5      resident individual with total income up to ` 5,00,000 do not pay \\nany tax due to rebate under both old and new regime. it is \\nproposed to increase the rebate for the resident individual under \\nthe new regime so that they do not pay tax if their total income is \\nup to ` 7,00,000. \\na.6     standard deduction of ` 50,000 to salaried individual, and 36 \\n \\n \\n deduction from family pension up to ` 15,000, is currently allowed \\nonly under the old regime. it is proposed to allow these two \\ndeductions under the new regime also. \\n a.7      surcharge on income-tax under both old regime and new regime is \\n10 per cent if income is above ` 5 0 lakh and up to ` 1 crore, 15 per \\ncent if income is above  `1 crore and up to ` 2 crore, 25 per cent if \\nincome is above ` 2 crore and up to ` 5 crore, and 37 per cent if \\nincome is above ` 5 crore. it is proposed that the for those \\nindividuals, huf, aop (other than co-operative), boi and ajp \\nunder the new regime, surcharge would be same except that the \\nsurcharge rate of 37 per cent will not apply. highest surcharge \\nshall be 25 per cent for income above  \\n` 2 crore. this would reduce the maximum rate from about 42.7 \\nper cent to about 39 per cent. no change in surcharge is proposed \\nfor those who opt to be under the old regime. \\na.8      encashment of earned leave up to 10 months of average salary, at \\nthe time of retirement in case of an employee (other than an \\nemployee of the central government or state government), is \\nexempt under sub-clause (ii) of clause (10aa) of section 10 of the \\nincome-tax act (“the act”) to the extent notified. the maximum \\namount which can be exempted is ` 3 lakh at present. it is \\nproposed to issue notification to extend this limit to ` 25 lakh.  \\nb. socio-economic welfare measures  \\nb.1 promoting  timely payments to micro and small enterprises  \\nin order to promote timely payments to micro and small \\nenterprises, it is proposed to include payments made to such \\nenterprises within the ambit of section 43b of the act. thus, \\ndeduction for such payments would be allowed only when actually \\npaid. it will be allowed on accrual basis only if the payment is \\nwithin the time mandated under the micro, small and medium \\nenterprises development act. \\nb.2 agnipath scheme, 2022 \\nthe payment received from the agniveer corpus fund by the \\nagniveers enrolled in agnipath scheme, 2022 is proposed to be \\nexempt from taxes. deduction in the computation of total income \\nis proposed to be allowed to the agniveer on the contribution 37 \\n \\n \\n made by him or the central government to his seva nidhi \\naccount. \\nb.3 relief to sugar co-operatives from past demand \\nit is proposed that for sugar co-operatives, for years prior to a.y. \\n2016-17, if any deduction claimed for expenditure made on \\npurchase of sugar has been disallowed, an application may be \\nmade to the assessing officer, who shall recompute the income of \\nthe relevant previous year after allowing such deduction up to the \\nprice fixed or approved by the government for such previous year.  \\nb.4 increasing threshold limit for co-operatives to withdraw cash \\nwithout tds \\nit is proposed to enable co-operatives to withdraw cash up to ` 3 \\ncrore in a year without being subjected to tds on such \\nwithdrawal.  \\nb.5 penalty for cash loan/transactions against primary co-operatives \\nit is proposed to  amend section 269ss of the act to provide that \\nwhere a deposit is accepted by a primary agricultural credit \\nsociety or a primary co-operative agricultural and rural \\ndevelopment bank from its member or a loan is taken from a \\nprimary agricultural credit society or a primary co-operative \\nagricultural and rural development bank by its member in cash, no \\npenal consequence would arise, if the amount of such loan or \\ndeposit in cash is less than  ` 2 lakh. further, section 269t of the \\nact is proposed to be amended to provide that where a deposit is \\nrepaid by a primary agricultural credit society or a primary co-\\noperative agricultural and rural development bank to its member \\nor such loan is repaid to a primary agricultural credit society or a \\nprimary co-operative agricultural and rural development bank by \\nits member in cash, no penal consequence shall arise, if the \\namount of such loan or deposit in cash is less than ` 2 lakh. \\nb.6 relief to start-ups in carrying forward and setting off of losses \\nthe condition of continuity of at least 51 per cent shareholding for \\nsetting off of carried forward losses is relaxed for an eligible start \\nup if all the shareholders of the company continue to hold those \\nshares. at present this relaxation applies for losses incurred during \\nthe period of 7 years from incorporation of such start-up. it is 38 \\n \\n \\n propos ed to increase this period to 10 years.  \\nb.7 extension of date of incorporation for eligible start up for \\nexemption  \\ncertain start-ups are eligible for some tax benefit if they are \\nincorporated before 1st april, 2023. the period of incorporation of \\nsuch eligible start-ups is proposed to be extended by one year to \\nbefore 1st april, 2024.  \\nb.8 gold to electronic gold receipt \\nthe conversion of physical gold to electronic gold receipt and vice \\nversa is proposed not to be treated as a transfer and not to attract \\nany capital gains. this would promote investments in electronic \\nequivalent of gold. \\nb.9 incentives to ifsc \\nrelocation of funds to ifsc has certain tax exemptions, if the \\nrelocation is before 31.03.2023. this date is proposed to be \\nextended to 31.03.2025. further, any distributed income from the \\noffshore derivative instruments entered into with an offshore \\nbanking unit is also proposed to be exempted subject to certain \\nconditions. \\nb.10 exemption to development authorities etc. \\nit is proposed to provide exemption to any income arising to a \\nbody or authority or board or trust or commission, (not being a \\ncompany) which  has been established or constituted by or under \\na central or state act with the purposes of satisfying the need for \\nhousing or for planning, development or improvement of cities, \\ntowns and villages or for regulating any activity or matter, \\nirrespective of whether it is carrying out commercial activity. \\nb.11 facilitating certain strategic disinvestments \\nto facilitate certain strategic disinvestments, it is proposed to \\nallow carry forward of accumulated losses and unabsorbed \\ndepreciation allowance in the case of amalgamation of one or \\nmore banking company with any other banking institution or a \\ncompany subsequent to a strategic disinvestment, if such \\namalgamation takes place within 5 years of strategic \\ndisinvestment. it is also proposed to modify the definition of \\n‘strategic disinvestment’. 39 \\n \\n \\n b.12  15 per cent concessional tax to promote new manufacturing co -\\noperative society \\nin order to promote the growth of manufacturing in co-operative \\nsector, a new co-operative society formed on or after 01.04.2023, \\nwhich commences manufacturing or production by 31.03.2024 \\nand do not avail of any specified incentive or deduction, is \\nproposed to be allowed an option to pay tax at a

the board. \\nformat for reporting of such expenses by the assessee shall be \\nprescribed. \\nc.2 increasing threshold limits for presumptive taxation schemes \\nin order to ease compliance and to promote non-cash \\ntransactions, it is proposed to increase the threshold limits for \\npresumptive scheme of taxation for eligible businesses from ` 2 \\ncrore to ` 3 crore and for specified professions from ` 50 lakh to  \\n` 75 lakh. the increased limit will apply only in case the amount or \\naggregate of the amounts received during the year, in cash, does \\nnot exceed five per cent

among all large economies.  \\n3. i recognise we are in the midst of an omicron wave, with high \\nincidence, but milder symptoms. further, the speed and coverage of our \\nvaccination campaign  has helped greatly. with the accelerated \\nimprovement of health infrastructure in the past two years, we are in a \\nstrong position to withstand challenges.  i am confident that with sabka \\nprayas we

significant \\nprogress and have been provided with adequate allocations in this budget \\nas well.  \\n9. the strengthening of health infrastructure, speedy implementation \\nof the vaccination programme, and the nation -wide resilient response to \\nthe current wave of the pandemic, are evident for all.  \\n10. the productivity linked incentive in 14 sectors for achieving the \\nvision of

region (pm -\\ndevine)  \\n57. a new scheme, prime minister’s development initiative for north -\\neast, pm -devine, will be implemented through the north -eastern council. it \\nwill fund  infrastructure, in the spirit of pm gatishakti, and social \\ndevelopment projects based on felt needs of the north -east. this will \\nenable livelihood activities for youth and women, filling the gaps in various \\nsectors. it will not be a substitute for existin g central or state schemes. \\nwhile the central ministries may also pose their candidate projects, priority \\nwill be given to those posed by the states. an initial allocation of ` 1,500 \\ncrore will be made, and the initial list of projects is given in annexure -1.  \\naspirational blocks programme  \\n58. our vision to improve the quality of life of citizens in the most \\nbackward districts of the country through aspirational districts programme \\nhas been translated into reality in a short span of time. 95 per cent of those \\n112 districts have made significant progress in key sectors such as health, \\nnutrition, financial inclusion and basic infrastructure. they have surpassed \\nthe state average values. however, in those districts, some blocks continue \\nto lag. in 2022 -23, the prog ramme will focus on such blocks in those \\ndistricts .    \\nvibrant villages programme  \\n59. border villages with sparse population, limited connectivity and \\ninfrastructure often get left out from the development gains. such villages \\non the northern border will be c overed under the new vibrant villages \\nprogramme. the activities will include construction of village infrastructure, \\nhousing, tourist centres, road connectivity, provisioning of decentralized \\nrenewable energy, direct to home access for doordarshan and educ ational \\nchannels, and support for livelihood generation. additional funding for \\nthese activities will be provided. existing schemes will be converged. we will \\ndefine their outcomes and monitor them on a constant basis.  \\nanytime – anywhere post office saving s \\n60. in 2022, 100 per cent of 1.5 lakh post offices will come on the core \\nbanking system enabling financial inclusion and access to accounts through 11 \\n \\n \\n net banking, mobile banking, atms, and also provide online transfer of \\nfunds between post office accounts and bank accounts. this will be helpful, \\nespecially for farmers and senior citizens in rural areas, enabling inter -\\noperability and financial inclusion.  \\ndigital banking  \\n61. in recent years, digital banking, digital payments and fintech  \\ninnovations have grown at a rapid pace in the country. government is \\ncontinuously encouraging these sectors to ensure that the benefits of digital \\nbanking reach every nook and corner of the country in a consumer -friendly \\nmanner. taking forward this agenda , and to mark 75 years of our \\nindependence, it is proposed to set up 75 digital banking units (dbus) in 75 \\ndistricts of the country by scheduled commercial banks.  \\ndigital payments  \\n62. the financial support for digital payment ecosystem announced in \\nthe previ ous budget will continue in 2022 -23. this will encourage further \\nadoption of digital payments. there will also be a focus to promote use of \\npayment platforms that are economical and user friendly.  \\nproductivity enhancement & investment, sunrise opportunitie s, energy \\ntransition, and climate action  \\nproductivity enhancement & investment  \\nease of doing business 2.0 & ease of living  \\n63. in recent years, over 25,000 compliances were reduced and 1486 \\nunion laws were repealed. this is the result of our government’s stron g \\ncommitment for ‘minimum government & maximum governance’, our trust \\nin the public, and ease of doing business (eodb).  \\n64. for the amrit kaal , the next phase of ease of doing business eodb \\n2.0 and ease of living, will be launched. in our endeavour to improve \\nproductive efficiency of capital and human resources, we will follow the \\nidea of ‘trust -based governance’.  \\n65. this new phase will be guided by an active involvement of the \\nstates, digitisation of manual processes and interventions, integration of the \\ncentral and state -level systems through it bridges, a single point access for \\nall citizen -centric services, and a standardization and removal of \\noverlapping compliances. crowdsourcing of suggestions and ground level 12 \\n \\n \\n assessment of the impact with active involvement  of citizens and businesses \\nwill be encouraged.  \\ngreen clearances  \\n66. a single window portal, parivesh, for all green clearances was \\nlaunched in 2018. it has been instrumental in reducing the time required for \\napprovals significantly. the scope of this portal will now be expanded, to \\nprovide information to the applicants. based on location of units, \\ninformation about specific approvals will be provided. it will enable \\napplication for all four approvals through a single form, and tracking of the \\nprocess through centralized processing centre -green (cpc -green).  \\ne-passport  \\n67. the issuance of e -passports using embedded chip and futuristic \\ntechnology will be rolled out in 2022 -23 to enhance convenience for the \\ncitizens in their overseas travel.  \\nurban development  \\n68. by the time of india @ 100, nearly half our population is likely to be \\nliving in urban areas. to prepare for this, orderly urban development is of \\ncritical importance. this will help realize the country’s economic potential, \\nincluding livelihood opportunities for  the demographic dividend. for this, on \\nthe one hand we need to nurture the megacities and their hinterlands to \\nbecome current centres of economic growth. on the other hand, we need \\nto facilitate tier 2 and 3 cities to take on the mantle in the future. thi s \\nwould require us to reimagine our cities into centres of sustainable living \\nwith opportunities for all, including women and youth. for this to happen, \\nurban planning cannot continue with a business -as-usual approach. we plan \\nto steer a paradigm change.     \\n69. a high -level committee of reputed urban planners, urban \\neconomists and institutions will be formed to make recommendations on \\nurban sector policies, capacity building, planning, implementation and \\ngovernance.  \\nurban planning support to states  \\n70. for urban c apacity building, support will be provided to the states. \\nmodernization of building byelaws, town planning schemes (tps), and \\ntransit oriented development (tod) will be implemented. this will \\nfacilitate reforms for people to

and their \\nimplementation for facilitating tod and tps by the states.   \\n71. for developing india specific knowledge in urban planning and \\ndesign, and to deliver certified training in these areas, up to five existing \\nacademic institutions in different regions will be designated as centres of \\nexcellence. these centres will be provid ed endowment funds of ` 250 crore \\neach. in addition, aicte will take the lead to improve syllabi, quality and \\naccess of urban planning courses in other institutions.  \\nclean & sustainable mobility  \\n72. we will promote a shift to use of public transport in urban a reas. \\nthis will be complemented by clean tech and governance solutions, special \\nmobility zones with zero fossil -fuel policy, and ev vehicles.  \\nbattery swapping policy  \\n73. considering the constraint of space in urban areas for setting up \\ncharging stations at scale, a battery swapping policy will be brought out and \\ninter -operability standards will be formulated. the private sector will be \\nencouraged to develop sustainable and  innovative business models for \\n‘battery or energy as a service’. this will improve efficiency in the ev eco -\\nsystem.  \\nland records management  \\n74. efficient use of land resources is a strong imperative. states will be \\nencouraged to adopt unique land parcel ide ntification number to facilitate \\nit-based management of records. the facility for transliteration of land \\nrecords across any of the schedule viii languages will also be rolled out.  \\n75. the adoption or linkage with national generic document \\nregistration system (ngdrs) with the ‘one -nation one -registration \\nsoftware’ will be promoted as an option for uniform process for registration \\nand ‘anywhere registration’ of deeds & documents.  \\ninsolvency and bankruptcy code  \\n76. necessary amendments in the code will be carried ou t to enhance \\nthe efficacy of the resolution process and facilitate cross border insolvency \\nresolution.  \\n 14 \\n \\n \\n accelerated corporate exit  \\n77. several it -based systems have been established for accelerated \\nregistration of new companies. now the centre for processing a ccelerated \\ncorporate exit (c -pace) with process re -engineering, will be established to \\nfacilitate and speed up the voluntary winding -up of these companies from \\nthe currently required 2 years to less than 6 months.      \\ngovernment procurement  \\n78. government rul es have recently been modernized for the needs the \\namrit kaal . the new rules have benefitted from the inputs from various \\nstakeholders. the modernised rules allow use of transparent quality criteria \\nbesides cost in evaluation of complex tenders. provisions  have been made \\nfor payment of 75 per cent of running bills, mandatorily within 10 days and \\nfor encouraging settlement of disputes through conciliation.  \\n79. as a further step to enhance transparency and to reduce delays in \\npayments, a completely paperless, end -to-end online e -bill system will be \\nlaunched for use by all central ministries for their procurements. the \\nsystem will enable the suppliers and contractors to submit online their \\ndigitally signed bills and claims and track their status from anywhere.  \\n80. to reduce indirect cost for suppliers and work -contractors, the use \\nof surety bonds as a substitute for bank guarantee will be made acceptable \\nin government procurements. business such as gold imports may also find \\nthis useful. irdai has given the framework f or issue of surety bonds by \\ninsurance companies.  \\navgc promotion task force  \\n81. the animation, visual effects, gaming, and comic (avgc) sector \\noffers immense potential to employ youth. an avgc promotion task force \\nwith all stakeholders will be set -up to recomm end ways to realize this and \\nbuild domestic capacity for serving our markets and the global demand.    \\ntelecom sector \\n82. telecommunication in general, and 5g technology in particular, can \\nenable growth and offer job opportunities. required spectrum auctions w ill \\nbe conducted in 2022 to facilitate rollout of 5g mobile services within 2022 -\\n23 by private telecom providers.  \\n83. a scheme for design -led manufacturing will be launched to build a \\nstrong ecosystem for 5g as part of the production linked incentive scheme.  15 \\n \\n \\n 84. to enable affordable broadband and mobile service proliferation in \\nrural and remote areas,  five per cent of annual collections under the \\nuniversal service obligation fund will be allocated. this will promote r&d \\nand commercialization of technologies and solutions.  \\n85. our vision is that all villages and their residents should have the \\nsame access to e -services, communication facilities, and digital resources as \\nurban areas and their residents. the contracts for laying optical fibre in all \\nvillages, including remote area s, will be awarded under the bharatnet \\nproject through ppp in 2022 -23. completion is expected in 2025. measures \\nwill be taken to enable better and more efficient use of the optical fibre.    \\nexport promotion  \\n86. the special economic zones act will be replaced with a new \\nlegislation that will enable the states to become partners in ‘development \\nof enterprise and service hubs’. this will cover all large existing and new \\nindustrial enclaves to optimally utilise available infrastructure and enhance \\ncompetitiveness of exports.      \\natmanirbharta in defence  \\n87. our government is committed to reducing imports and promoting \\natmanirbharta  in equipment for the armed forces. 68 per cent of the \\ncapital procurement budget will be earmarked for domestic industry in \\n2022 -23, up fr om 58 per cent in  2021 -22.  \\n88. defence r&d will be opened up for industry, startups and academia \\nwith 25 per cent of defence r&d budget earmarked.  private industry will \\nbe encouraged to take up design and development of military platforms and \\nequipment in co llaboration with drdo and other organizations through spv \\nmodel. an independent nodal umbrella body will be set up for meeting \\nwide ranging testing and certification requirements.  \\nsunrise opportunities  \\n89. artificial intelligence, geospatial systems and drone s, \\nsemiconductor and its eco -system, space economy, genomics and \\npharmaceuticals, green energy, and clean mobility systems have immense \\npotential to assist sustainable development at scale and modernize the \\ncountry. they provide employment opportunities fo r youth, and make \\nindian industry more efficient and competitive.  16 \\n \\n \\n 90. supportive policies, light -touch regulations, facilitative actions to \\nbuild domestic capacities, and promotion of research & development will \\nguide the government’s approach. for r&d in the se sunrise opportunities, \\nin addition to efforts of collaboration among academia, industry and public \\ninstitutions, government contribution will be provided.  \\nenergy transition and climate action  \\n91. the risks of climate change are the strongest negative extern alities \\nthat affect india and other countries. as hon’ble prime minister said at the \\ncop26 summit in glasgow last november, “what is needed today is mindful \\nand deliberate utilisation, instead of mindless and destructive \\nconsumption.” the low carbon develo pment strategy as enunciated in the \\n‘panchamrit’ that he announced is an important reflection of our \\ngovernment’s strong commitment towards sustainable development.  \\n92. this strategy opens up huge employment opportunities and will take \\nthe country on a sustai nable development path.  this budget proposes \\nseveral near -term and long -term actions accordingly.  \\nsolar power  \\n93. to facilitate domestic manufacturing for the ambitious goal of 280 \\ngw of installed solar capacity by 2030, an

businesses and \\njobs. the action plans for ten sectors such as electronic waste, end -of-life \\nvehicles, used oil waste, and toxic & hazardous industrial waste are ready. \\nthe focus no w will be on addressing important cross cutting issues of \\ninfrastructure, reverse logistics, technology upgradation and integration \\nwith informal sector. this will be supported by active public policies \\ncovering regulations, extended producers’ responsibil ities framework and \\ninnovation facilitation.  \\ntransition to carbon neutral economy  \\n95. five to seven per cent biomass pellets will be co -fired in thermal \\npower plants resulting in co2 savings of 38 mmt annually. this will also 17 \\n \\n \\n provide extra income to farmers an d job opportunities to locals and help \\navoid stubble burning in agriculture fields.  \\n96. saving energy is an important aspect of energy management. hence, \\nenergy efficiency and savings measures will be promoted. this will be done \\nin large commercial buildings through the energy service company (esco) \\nbusiness model. it will facilitate capacity building and awareness for energy \\naudits, performance contracts, and common measurement & verification \\nprotocol.  \\n97. four pilot projects for coal gasification and conversion of coal into \\nchemicals required for the industry will be set -up to evolve technical and \\nfinancial viability.  \\n98. the policies and required legislative changes to promote agro \\nforestry and private forestry will be brought in. in addition, financial support \\nwill be provided to farmers belonging to scheduled castes and scheduled \\ntribes, who want to take up agro -forestry.  \\nfinancing of investments  \\npublic capital investment  \\n99. capital investment holds the key to speedy and sustained economic \\nrevival and consolidation through its multiplier effect. capital investment \\nalso helps in creating employment opportunities, inducing enhanced \\ndemand for manufactured inputs from large indus tries and msmes, services \\nfrom professionals, and help farmers through better agri -infrastructure. the \\neconomy has shown strong resilience to come out of the effects of the \\npandemic with high growth. however, we need to sustain that level to \\nmake up for th e setback of 2020 -21.  \\n100. as outlined in para 5 earlier, the virtuous cycle of investment \\nrequires public investment to crowd -in private investment.  at this stage, \\nprivate investments seem to require that support to rise to their potential \\nand to the needs o f the economy. public investment must continue to take \\nthe lead and pump -prime the private investment and demand in 2022 -23.    \\n101. considering the above imperative, the outlay for capital expenditure \\nin the union budget is once again being stepped up sharply by 35.4 per cent \\nfrom ` 5.54 lakh crore in the current year to ` 7.50 lakh crore in 2022 -23. \\nthis has increased to more than 2.2 times the expenditure of 2019 -20. this \\noutlay in 2022 -23 will be 2.9 per cent of gdp.    18 \\n \\n \\n effective capital expenditure  \\n102. with th is investment taken together with the provision made for \\ncreation of capital assets through grants -in-aid to states, the ‘effective \\ncapital expenditure’ of the central government is estimated at ` 10.68 lakh \\ncrore in  2022 -23, which will be about 4.1 per c ent of gdp.   \\ngreen bonds  \\n103. as a part of the government’s overall market borrowings in 2022 -23, \\nsovereign green bonds will be issued for mobilizing resources for green \\ninfrastructure. the proceeds will be deployed in public sector projects \\nwhich help in red ucing the carbon intensity of the economy.   \\ngift -ifsc  \\n104. world -class foreign universities and institutions will be allowed in \\nthe gift city to offer courses in financial management, fintech, science, \\ntechnology, engineering and mathematics free from domestic  regulations, \\nexcept those by ifsca to facilitate availability of high -end human resources \\nfor financial services and technology.  \\n105. an international arbitration centre will be set up in the gift city for \\ntimely settlement of disputes under international jur isprudence.  \\n106. services for global capital for sustainable & climate finance in the \\ncountry will be facilitated in the gift city.  \\ninfrastructure status  \\n107. data centres and energy storage systems including dense charging \\ninfrastructure and grid -scale battery syst ems will be included in the \\nharmonized list of infrastructure. this will facilitate credit availability for \\ndigital infrastructure and clean energy storage.  \\nventure capital and private equity investment  \\n108. venture capital and private equity invested more than  ` 5.5 lakh \\ncrore last year facilitating one of the largest start -up and growth ecosystem. \\nscaling up this investment requires a holistic examination of regulatory and \\nother frictions. an expert committee will be set up to examine and suggest \\nappropriate m easures.  \\n \\n 19 \\n \\n \\n blended finance  \\n109. government backed funds niif and sidbi fund of funds have \\nprovided scale capital creating a multiplier effect. for encouraging \\nimportant sunrise sectors such as climate action, deep -tech, digital \\neconomy, pharma and agri -tech, the government will promote thematic \\nfunds for blended finance with the government share being limited to 20 \\nper cent and the funds being managed by private fund managers.   \\nfinancial viability of infrastructure projects  \\n110. for financing the infrastruc ture needs, the stepping -up of public \\ninvestment will need to be complemented by private capital at a significant \\nscale. measures will be taken to enhance financial viability of projects \\nincluding ppp, with technical and knowledge assistance from multi -lateral \\nagencies. enhancing financial viability shall also be obtained by adopting \\nglobal best practices, innovative ways of financing, and balanced risk \\nallocation.  \\ndigital rupee  \\n111. introduction of central bank digital currency (cbdc) will give a big \\nboost to d igital economy. digital currency will also lead to a more efficient \\nand cheaper currency management system. it is, therefore, proposed to \\nintroduce digital rupee, using blockchain and other technologies, to be \\nissued by the reserve bank of india starting 2 022-23.  \\nfinancial assistance to states for capital investment  \\n112. reflecting the true spirit of cooperative federalism, the central \\ngovernment is committed to bolstering the hands of the states in \\nenhancing their capital investment towards creating productive  assets and \\ngenerating remunerative employment. the ‘scheme for financial assistance \\nto states for capital investment’ has been extremely well received by the \\nstates. in deference to the requests received during my meeting with chief \\nministers and state fi nance ministers, the outlay for this scheme is being \\nenhanced from ` 10,000 crore in the budget estimates to ` 15,000 crore in \\nthe revised estimates for the current year.  \\n113. for 2022 -23, the allocation is ` 1 lakh crore to assist the states in \\ncatalysing ove rall investments in the economy.  these fifty -year interest \\nfree loans are over and above the normal borrowings allowed to the states.  20 \\n \\n \\n 114. this allocation will be used for pm gatishakti related and other \\nproductive capital investment of the states. it will al so include components \\nfor:  \\n\\uf0b7 supplemental funding for priority segments of pm gram sadak \\nyojana, including support for the states’ share,  \\n\\uf0b7 digitisation of the economy, including digital payments and \\ncompletion of ofc network, and  \\n\\uf0b7 reforms related to building byelaws, town planning schemes, \\ntransit -oriented development, and transferable development \\nrights.  \\n115. in 2022 -23, in accordance with the recommendations of the 15th \\nfinance commission, the states will be allowed a fiscal deficit of 4 per cent \\nof gsdp of whic h 0.5 per cent will be tied to power sector reforms, for \\nwhich the conditions have already been communicated in 2021 -22.    \\nfiscal management  \\n116. as against a total expenditure of ` 34.83  lakh crore  projected in the \\nbudget estimates 2021 -22, the revised estimate is ` 37.70  lakh crore. the \\nrevised estimate of capital expenditure is ` 6.03 lakh  crore. this includes an \\namount of ` 51,971  crore towards settlement of outstanding guaranteed \\nliabilities of air india and its other sundry commitments.      \\n117. coming to the budget estimates, the total expenditure in 2022 -23 is \\nestimated at ` 39.45  lakh crore, while the total receipts other than \\nborrowings are estimated at ` 22.84  lakh c rore. \\n118. the revised fiscal deficit in the current year is estimated at 6.9 per \\ncent of gdp as against 6.8 per cent projected in the budget estimates. the \\nfiscal deficit in 2022 -23 is estimated at 6.4 per cent of gdp, which is \\nconsistent with the broad path of fisc al consolidation announced by me last \\nyear to reach a fiscal deficit level below 4.5 per cent by 2025 -26. while \\nsetting the fiscal deficit level in 2022 -23, i am conscious of the need to \\nnurture growth, through public investment, to become stronger and \\nsustainable.   \\ni will, now, move to part b of my speech.  \\n \\n 21 \\n \\npart b  \\ndirect tax  \\n119. hon'ble speaker, sir, i take this opportunity to thank all the \\ntaxpayers of our country who have contributed immensely and \\nstrengthened the hands of the government in helping their fellow citizens in \\nthis hour of need.   \\n \\n       दापियâवाकरंधìय«राõůंिनâयंयथािविध।  \\nअशेषाæकðपयेþाजायोग±ेमानतिæþतः॥ ११॥ \\n \\ndāpayitvākara ṃdharmya ṃrāṣṭraṃnitya ṃyathāvidhi |  \\naśeṣānkalpayedrājāyogak ṣemānatandrita ḥ || \\n \\n“the king must make arrangements for yogakshema  (welfare) \\nof the populace by way of abandoning any laxity and by \\ngoverning the state in line with dharma, along with collecting \\ntaxes which are in consonance with the dharma.”  \\nmahabharat, shanti parvaadhyaya. 72. shlok 11  \\n120. drawing wisdom from our ancient texts, we continue on the path to \\nprogress. the proposals in this budget, while continuing with our declared \\npolicy of stable and predictable tax regime, intend to bring more reforms \\nthat will take ahead our vision to establish a trustworthy tax re gime. this \\nwill further simplify the tax system, promote voluntary compliance by \\ntaxpayers, and reduce litigation.  \\nintroducing new ‘updated return’  \\n121.  india is growing at an accelerated pace and people are undertaking \\nmultiple financial transactions. the  income tax department has established \\na robust framework of reporting of taxpayers' transactions. in this context, \\nsome taxpayers may realize that they have committed omissions or \\nmistakes in correctly estimating their income for tax payment.  to provide \\nan opportunity to correct such errors, i am proposing a new provision 22 \\n \\npermitting taxpayers to file an updated return on payment of additional \\ntax. this updated return can be filed within two years from the end of the \\nrelevant assessment year.  \\n \\n122.     presently, if the department finds out that some income has been \\nmissed out by the assessee, it goes through a lengthy process of \\nadjudication. instead, with this proposal now, there will be a trust reposed \\nin the taxpayers that will enable the assesse e herself to declare the income \\nthat she may have missed out earlier while filing her return. full details of \\nthe proposal are given in the finance bill.  it is an affirmative step in the \\ndirection of voluntary tax compliance.   \\nreduced alternate minimum ta x rate and surcharge for cooperatives  \\n123. currently, cooperative societies are required to pay alternate \\nminimum tax at the rate of eighteen and one half per cent. however, \\ncompanies pay the same at the rate of fifteen per cent. to provide a level \\nplaying  field between co -operative societies and companies, i, propose to \\nreduce this rate for the cooperative societies also to fifteen per cent.  \\n124.  i also propose to reduce the surcharge on co -operative societies \\nfrom present 12  per cent  to 7  per cent  for tho se having total income of \\nmore than ` 1 crore and up to ` 10 crores.  \\n125.  this would help in enhancing the income of cooperative societies \\nand its members who are mostly from rural and farming communities.  \\ntax relief to persons with disability  \\n126.   the parent or guardian of a differently abled person can take an \\ninsurance scheme for such person. the present law provides for deduction \\nto the parent or guardian only if the lump sum payment or annuity is \\navailable to the differently abled person on the death of the subscriber i.e. \\nparent or guardian.  \\n127. there could be situations where differently abled dependants may \\nneed payment of annuity or lump sum amount even during the lifetime of \\ntheir parents/guardians. i propose to thus allow the payment of a nnuity and \\nlump sum amount to the differently abled dependent during the lifetime of \\nparents/guardians, i.e., on parents/ guardians attaining the age of sixty \\nyears.  \\nparity between employees of state and central government  \\n128. at present, the central gove rnment contributes 14  per cent  of the \\nsalary of its employee to the national pension system (nps) tier -i. this is \\nallowed as a deduction in computing the income of the employee.   23 \\n \\nhowever, such deduction is allowed only to the extent of 10  per cent  of the \\nsalary in case of employees of the state government.  to provide equal \\ntreatment to both central and state government employees, i propose to \\nincrease the tax deduction limit from 10  per cent  to 14  per cent  on \\nemployer’s contribution to the nps account of state government \\nemployees as well. this would help in enhancing the social security benefits \\nof the state government employees and bring them at par with central \\ngovernment employees.  \\n \\nincentives for start -ups \\n129. start -ups have emerged as drivers of gro wth for our economy. over  \\nthe past few years, the country has seen a manifold increase in successful \\nstart -ups. eligible  start -ups established before 31.3.2022 had been provided \\na tax incentive for three consecutive years out of ten years from \\nincorporation. in view of the covid pandemic, i propose to extend the \\nperiod of incorporation of the eligible start -up by one more ye ar, that is, up \\nto 31.03.2023 for providing such tax incentive.  \\nincentives for newly incorporated manufacturing entities under \\nconcessional tax regime  \\n130. in an effort to establish a globally competitive business environment \\nfor certain domestic companies , a concessional tax regime of 15  per cent  tax \\nwas introduced by our government for newly incorporated domestic \\nmanufacturing companies. i propose to extend the last date for \\ncommencement of manufacturing or production under section 115bab by \\none year i.e.  from 31st march, 2023 to 31st march, 2024.  \\nscheme for taxation of virtual digital assets  \\n131. there has been a phenomenal increase in transactions in virtual \\ndigital assets.  the magnitude and frequency of these transactions have \\nmade it imperative to pr ovide for a specific tax regime.  accordingly,  for the \\ntaxation of virtual digital assets, i propose to provide that any income from \\ntransfer of any virtual digital asset shall be taxed at the rate of 30  per cent . \\n\\uf0b7 no deduction in respect of any expenditure  or allowance shall be \\nallowed while computing such income except cost of acquisition. \\nfurther, loss from transfer of virtual digital asset cannot be set \\noff against any other income.  \\n\\uf0b7 further, in order to capture the transaction details, i also \\npropose to provide for tds on payment made in relation to 24 \\n \\ntransfer of virtual digital asset at the rate of 1  per cent  of such \\nconsideration above a monetary threshold.  \\n\\uf0b7 gift of virtual digital ass et is also proposed to be taxed in the \\nhands of the recipient.  \\n \\nlitigation management to avoid repetitive appeals by the department  \\n132. it has been observed that a lot of time and resources are consumed \\nin filing of appeals which involve identical issues. taking forward our policy \\nof sound litigation management, i propose to provide that, if a question of \\nlaw in the case of an assessee is identical to a question of law which is \\npending in appeal before the jurisdictional high court or the supreme court \\nin any case, the filing of further appeal in the case of this assessee by the \\ndepartment shall be deferred till such question of law is deci ded by the \\njurisdictional high court or the supreme court. this will greatly help in \\nreducing the repeated litigation between taxpayers and the department.  \\n \\ntax incentives to ifsc  \\n133. taking forward our efforts to further promote the ifsc, i hereby \\npropos e to provide that income of a non -resident from offshore derivative \\ninstruments, or over the counter derivatives issued by an offshore banking \\nunit, income from royalty and interest on account of lease of ship and \\nincome received from portfolio management services in ifsc shall be \\nexempt from tax, subject to specified conditions.  \\n134.  rationalization of surcharge  \\n\\uf0b7 in the globalized business world , there are several works contracts \\nwhose terms and conditions mandatorily require formation of a \\nconsortium. th e members in the consortium are generally \\ncompanies. in such cases, the income of these aops has to suffer a \\ngraded surcharge upto 37  per cent , which is a lot more than the \\nsurcharge on the individual companies. accordingly, i propose to cap \\nthe surcharge of these aop’s at 15  per cent . \\n\\uf0b7 further, the long -term capital gains on listed equity shares, units etc. \\nare liable to maximum surcharge of 15  per cent , while the other long \\nterm capital gains are subjected to a graded surcharge which goes up \\nto 37  per cent . i propose to cap the surcharge on long term capital \\ngains arising on transfer of any type of assets at 15  per cent . this \\nstep will give a boost to the start up community and along with my 25 \\n \\nproposal on extending tax benefits to manufacturing companies and \\nstart ups re affirms our commitment to atma nirbhar bharat. \\nclarification in relation to ‘health and education cess’ as business \\nexpenditure  \\n135. the income-tax is not an allowable expenditure for computation of \\nbusiness income. this includes tax as well as surcharges. the ‘health and \\neducation cess’ is imposed as an additional surcharge on the taxpayer for \\nfunding specific government welfare programs. however, some courts have \\nallowed ‘health and education ‘cess’ as business expenditure, which is \\nagainst the legislative intent. to reiterate the legislative intent, i propose to \\nclarify that any surcharge or cess on income and profits is not allowable as \\nbusiness expenditure. \\ndeterrence against tax-evasion:  \\n136.  presently, there is ambiguity regarding set off, of brought forward \\nloss against undisclosed income detected in search operations. it has been \\nobserved that in many cases where undisclosed income or suppression of \\nsales etc. is detected, payment of tax is avoided by setting off, of losses. in \\norder to bring certainty and to increase deterrence among tax evaders, i \\npropose to provide that no set off, of any loss shall be allowed against \\nundisclosed income detected during search and survey operations. \\nrationalizing tds provisions   \\n137.  it has been noticed that as a business promotion strategy, there is a \\ntendency on businesses to pass on benefits to their agents. such benefits \\nare taxable in the hands of the agents. in order to track such transactions, i \\npropose to provide for tax deduction by the person giving benefits, if the \\naggregate value of such benefits exceeds  ` 20,000 during the financial year.   \\n138.  a few other changes are being made the details of which are there in \\nthe finance bill.   \\n \\nindirect taxes \\nremarkable progress in gst :   \\n139. g st has been a landmark reform of independent india showcasing \\nthe spirit of cooperative federalism. while aspirations were high, there 26 \\n \\nwere huge challenges too. these challenges were overcome deftly and \\npainstakingly under the guidance and oversight of th e gst council.  we can \\nnow take pride in a fully it driven and progressive gst regime that has \\nfulfilled the cherished dream of india as one market - one tax. there are still \\nsome challenges remaining and we aspire to meet them in the coming year. \\nthe right  balance between facilitation and enforcement has engendered \\nsignificantly better compliance. gst revenues are buoyant despite the \\npandemic.   taxpayers deserve applause for this growth. not only did they \\nadapt to the changes but enthusiastically contribut ed to the cause by paying \\ntaxes.   \\nspecial economic zones:  \\n140.  in part a of my speech, i have referred to the proposed reforms in \\nsezs. alongside, we will also undertake reforms in customs administration \\nof sezs and it shall henceforth be fully it driven  and function on the \\ncustoms national portal with a focus on higher facilitation and with only \\nrisk-based checks. this will ease doing business by sez units considerably.  \\nthis reform shall be implemented by 30th september 2022.  \\ncustoms reforms  and duty ra te changes  \\n141.  customs administration has reinvented itself over the years through \\nliberalised procedures and infusion of technology. faceless customs has \\nbeen fully established. during covid -19 pandemic, customs formations have \\ndone exceptional frontline work against all odds displaying agility and \\npurpose. customs’ reforms have played a very vital role in domestic capacity \\ncreation, providing level playing field to our msmes, easing the raw material \\nsupply side constraints, enhancing ease of doing business and being an \\nenabler to other policy initiatives such as plis and phased manufacturing \\nplans. my proposals on customs side are aligned to these objectives.  \\nproject imports and capital goods  \\n142.  national capital goods policy, 2016 aims at doubling the production \\nof capital goods by 2025.  this would create employment opportunities and \\nresult in increased economic activity. however, several duty exemptions, \\neven extending to over three decade s in some cases, have been granted to \\ncapital goods for various sectors like power, fertilizer, textiles, leather, \\nfootwear, food processin g and fertilizers. these exemptions have hindered \\nthe growth of the domestic capital goods sector.   27 \\n \\n143.  similarl y, project import duty concessions have also deprived the \\nlocal producers of a level playing field in areas like coal mining projects, \\npower generation, transmission or distribution projects, railway and metro \\nprojects. our experience suggests that reasona ble tariffs are conducive to \\nthe growth of domestic industry and ‘make in india’ without significantly \\nimpacting the cost of essential imports.  \\n144.  accordingly, it is proposed to phase out the concessional rates in \\ncapital goods and project imports gradu ally and apply a moderate tariff of \\n7.5 per cent . certain exemptions for advanced machineries that are not \\nmanufactured within the country shall continue.  \\n145.  a few exemptions are being introduced on inputs, like specialised \\ncastings, ball screw and line ar motion guide, to encourage domestic \\nmanufacturing of capital goods.  \\nreview of customs exemptions and tariff simplification  \\n146.  in the last two budgets we have rationalised several customs \\nexemptions. we have once again carried out an extensive consulta tion, \\nincluding by crowd sourcing and as a result of these consultations, more \\nthan 350 exemption entries are proposed to be gradually phased out. these \\ninclude exemption on certain agricultural produce, chemicals, fabrics, \\nmedical devices and drugs and me dicines for which sufficient domestic \\ncapacity exists.  further, as a simplification measure, several concessional \\nrates are being incorporated in the customs tariff schedule itself instead of \\nprescribing them through various notifications.   \\n147.  this com prehensive review will simplify the customs rate and tariff \\nstructure particularly for sectors like chemicals, textiles and metals and \\nminimise disputes. removal of exemption on items which are or can be \\nmanufactured in india and providing concessional dut ies on raw material \\nthat go into manufacturing of intermediate products will go many a step \\nforward in achieving our objective of ‘make in india’ and ‘atmanirbhar \\nbharat’.  \\n148.  i shall now take up sector specific proposals.  \\nelectronics  \\n149.  electronic manu facturing has been growing rapidly. customs duty \\nrates are being calibrated to provide a graded rate structure to facilitate \\ndomestic manufacturing of wearable devices, hearable devices and 28 \\n \\nelectronic smart meters.  duty concessions are also being given to  parts of \\ntransformer of mobile phone chargers and camera lens of mobile camera \\nmodule and certain other items. this will enable domestic manufacturing of \\nhigh growth electronic items.  \\ngems and jewellery  \\n150.  to give a boost to the gems and jewellery secto r, customs duty on \\ncut and polished diamonds and gemstones is being reduced to 5  per cent . \\nsimply sawn diamond would attract nil customs duty. to facilitate export of \\njewellery through e -commerce, a simplified regulatory framework shall be \\nimplemented by j une this year. to disincentivise import of undervalued \\nimitation jewellery, the customs duty on imitation jewellery is being \\nprescribed in a manner that a duty of at least `  400 per kg is paid on its \\nimport.  \\nchemicals:  \\n151.  customs duty on certain critica l chemicals namely methanol, acetic \\nacid and heavy feed stocks for petroleum refining are being reduced, while \\nduty is being raised on sodium cyanide for which adequate domestic \\ncapacity exists. these changes will help in enhancing domestic value \\naddition.  \\nmsme  \\n152.  duty on umbrellas is being raised to 20  per cent . exemption to parts \\nof umbrellas is being withdrawn. exemption is also being rationalised on \\nimplements and tools for agri -sector which are manufactured in india. \\ncustoms duty exemption given to steel scrap last year is being extended for \\nanother year to provide relief to msme secondary steel producers. certain \\nanti- dumping and cvd on stainless steel and coated steel flat pr oducts, \\nbars of alloy steel and high -speed steel are being revoked in larger public \\ninterest considering prevailing high prices of metals.  \\nexports \\n153.  to incentivise exports, exemptions are being provided on items such \\nas embellishment, trimming, fasteners, buttons, zipper, lining material, \\nspecified leather, furniture fittings and packaging boxes that may be needed \\nby bonafide exporters of handicrafts, textiles and leather garments, leather \\nfootwear and other goods.  29 \\n \\n154.  duty is being reduced on certain inputs required for shrimp \\naquaculture so as to promote its exports.  \\ntariff measure to encourage blending of fuel  \\n155.  blending of fuel is a priority o f this government.   to encourage the \\nefforts for blending of fuel, unblended fuel shall attract an additional \\ndifferential excise duty of ` 2/ litre from the 1st day of october 2022.  \\n156.  a few other changes are being made in duty rates, customs tariff \\nand customs law the details of which are there in the finance bill.   \\n157.  mr speaker sir, with these words i commend the budget to this \\naugust house.   \\n 30 \\n \\nannex to part a of budget speech  \\n \\nannexure 1 \\n(refer para 57)

1-2022 \\n \\nspeech of  \\nnirmala sitharaman  \\nminister of finance  \\nfebru ary 1, 202 1 \\nhon’ble speaker,  \\ni present the  budget for the year 202 1-2022.  \\nintroduction  \\n1. honourable speaker, the preparation of this budget was undertaken \\nin circumstances like never before. we knew of calamities that have \\naffected a country or a region within a country, but what we have endured \\nwith covid -19 through 2020 is sui generis.  \\n \\n2. whe n i presented the budget 2020 -21, we could not have imagined \\nthat the global economy, already in throes of a slowdown, would be pushed \\ninto an unprecedented contraction.  \\n \\n3. we could not have also imagined then that our people as those in \\nother countries would have to endure the loss of near and dear ones and \\nsuffer hardships brought about due to a health crisis.  \\n \\n4. the risk of not having a lockdown was far too high. within 48 hours \\nof declaring a three -week -long complete lockdown, the prime minister \\nannounc ed the pradhan mantri garib kalyan yojana, valued at `2.76 lakh \\ncrores  – this provided,  free food grain to 800 million people, free cooking \\ngas for 80 million families for months, and cash directly to over 400 million \\nfarmers, women, elderly, the poor and  the needy.  \\n \\n 2 \\n \\n \\n 5. even as a large section of citizens stayed home, milk, vegetable, and \\nfruit -suppliers, health and sanitary workers, truck drivers, railways and \\npublic transport workers, bank employees, electricity workers, our \\nannadata s, police, firemen, and  the armed forces, all had to go about their \\nwork as normal, but with the additional anxiety of the virus hanging over \\nthem. we recognise this, and i think i speak on behalf of everybody in this \\naugust house, when i express my heartfelt gratitude to these men and \\nwomen, for how they were able to carry out their work and duty, to provide \\nfor the nation’s basics, over those crucial months.  \\n \\n6. speaker sir, for public good, honourable members of parliament \\nand members of legislative assemblies too offered their s alaries.  \\n \\n7. in may 2020, the government announced the atmanirbhar bharat \\npackage (anb 1.0) . to sustain the recovery, further into the year, we also \\nrolled out two more atmanirbhar bharat packages (anb 2.0 and anb 3.0). \\ntotal financial impact of all atmanirbh ar bharat packages including \\nmeasures taken by rbi was estimated to about `27.1 lakh crores  which \\namounts to more than 13% of gdp.  \\n \\n8. as a government, we kept a watch on the situation and were \\nproactive in our responses. the government, led by the prime minister, \\nstretched its resources to deliver for most vulnerable sections of our society \\n– the poorest of the poor, the dalits, tribals,  the elderly, the migrant \\nworkers, and our children. the pmgky, the three anb packages, and \\nannouncements made later were like five mini -budgets in themselves.  \\n \\n9. the atmanirbhar packages accelerated our pace of structural \\nreforms. redefinition of msmes , commercialisation of the mineral sector, \\nagriculture and labour reforms, privatisation of public sector undertakings, \\none nation one ration card, and production linked incentive schemes are \\nsome of the notable reforms carried out during this period.  fac eless \\nincome tax assessment, dbt and financial inclusion are the others.  \\n \\n10. today, india has two vaccines available, and has begun medically \\nsafeguarding not only her own citizens against covid -19, but also those of \\n100 or more countries. it is added comfor t to know that two or more \\nvaccines are also expected soon.  \\n 3 \\n \\n \\n 11. honourable prime minister launched the vaccination drive by \\ncrediting and thanking our scientists. we are ever grateful for the strength \\nand rigour of their efforts.  \\n \\n12. having said that, we are all  reminded time and again that our fight \\nagainst covid -19 continues into 2021.  \\n \\n13. now, just as it had happened after the two world wars, there are \\nsigns that the political, economic, and strategic relations in the post covid \\nworld are changing. this moment in  history is the dawn of a new era – one \\nin which india is well -poised to truly be the land of promise and hope.  \\n \\n''faith is the bird that feels the light and sings when the dawn is still dark''.  \\n-rabindranath tagore  \\n(fireflies – a collection of aphorisms)  \\n \\n14. in this spirit, i can’t help but recall the joy that we, as a cricket -loving \\nnation, felt after team india’s recent spectacular success in australia. it has \\nreminded us of all the qualities that we as a people, particularly our youth, \\nepitomise of having  abundant promise and the unsuppressed thirst to \\nperform and succeed.  \\n \\n15. today, data shows that india now has one of the lowest death rate \\nof 112 per million  population and one of the lowest active cases of  about \\n130 per million. this has laid the foundation  to the revival we are seeing \\nnow in the economy.  \\n \\n16. this budget will be the first of this new decade. this budget will also \\nbe a digital budget and that has happened with all your support.  \\n \\n17. so far, only three times has a budget followed a contraction in the  \\neconomy. all such contractions were as a result of situations typical to \\nindia. this time, the contraction in our economy is due to a global \\npandemic, just like in several other countries.  \\n \\n18. having said that, i want to confidently state that our government  is \\nfully prepared to support and facilitate the economy’s reset. this budget \\nprovides every opportunity for our economy to raise and capture the pace \\nthat it needs for sustainable growth.  \\n \\n19. 2021 is the year of many important milestones for our history. i \\nmention a few of these: it is the 75th year of independence; 60 years of \\ngoa’s accession to india; 50 years of the 1971 india -pakistan war; it will be 4 \\n \\n \\n the year of the 8th census of independent india; it will also be india’s turn \\nat the brics presidency; the  year for our chandrayaan -3 mission; and the \\nharidwar maha kumbh.  \\n \\n20. honourable speaker, before i commence part a of the budget, i \\nwant to take a moment to acknowledge how isolating and distancing \\nseemed like insurmountable challenges for a country like ours  that has \\npeople coming together in times of crises. it hurt us in many ways. i bow my \\nhead in respect to every citizen, for the endurance shown in facing what \\nwas an undeniably a tough year for all our physical and mental well -being.  \\n \\n \\npart a  \\n \\n21. in part a,  i wish to lay a vision for atmanirbhar bharat.  \\n \\n22. atmanirbharta is not a new idea. ancient india was largely self -\\nreliant, and equally, a business epicentre of the world.  \\n \\n23. atmanirbhar bharat is an expression of 130 crores  indians who have \\nfull confidence in their capabilities and skills.  \\n \\n24. we are already part of international groupings such as the g20 and \\nbrics. the coalition for disaster resilient infrastructure and the \\ninternational solar alliance are realities today due to india’s efforts.  \\n \\n25. the proposals in part a will further strengthen the sankalp of nation \\nfirst, doubling farmer’s income, strong infrastructure, healthy india, good \\ngovernance, opportunities for youth, education for all, women \\nempowerment, and inclusive development, among others.  \\n \\n26. additionally, also on the path to fast -implementation are the 13 \\npromises we had made in the budget of 2015 -16  which were to materialise \\nduring the amrut mahotsav of 2022, on the 75th year of our independence. \\nthey too resonate  with this vision of atmanirbharta.  \\n \\n27. the budget proposals for 202 1-2022 rest on 6 pillars.  \\ni. health and wellbeing  \\nii. physical & financial capital, and infrastructure  5 \\n \\n \\n iii. inclusive development for aspirational india  \\niv. reinvigorating human capital  \\nv. innovation and r&d  \\nvi. minimum government and maximum governance  \\n \\n1. health and wellbeing  \\n \\n28. even at the outset, i would like to say that the investment on health \\ninfrastructure in this budget has increased substantially. progressively, as \\ninstitutions absorb more, we shall commit more.  \\n \\n29. taking a holistic approach to health, we focus on strengthening \\nthree areas: preventive, curative, and wellbeing.  \\n \\nhealth systems  \\n \\n30. a new centrally sponsored scheme, pm atmanirbhar swasth bharat \\nyojana , will be launched with an outlay of  about  ` 64,180 crores over 6 \\nyears. this will develop capacities of primary, secondary, and tertiary care \\nhealth systems, strengthen existing national institutions, and create new \\ninstitutions, to cater to detection and cure of new and emerging diseases. \\nthis will be  in addition to the national health mission. the main \\ninterventions under the scheme are:  \\n \\na. support for 17,788 rural and 11,024 urban health and wellness \\ncenters  \\nb. setting up integrated public health labs in all districts and 3382 block \\npublic health units in  11 states;  \\nc. establishing critical care hospital blocks in 602 districts and 12 \\ncentral institutions;  \\nd. strengthening of the national centre for disease control (ncdc), its \\n5 regional branches and 20 metropolitan health surveillance units;  \\ne. expansion of the in tegrated health information portal to all \\nstates/uts to connect all public health labs;  \\nf. operationalisation of 17 new public health units and strengthening \\nof 33 existing public health units at points of entry, that is at 32 \\nairports, 11 seaports and 7 land  crossings;  \\ng. setting up of 15 health emergency operation centers and 2 mobile \\nhospitals; and  6 \\n \\n \\n h. setting up of a national institution for one health, a regional \\nresearch platform for who south east asia region, 9 bio -safety \\nlevel iii laboratories and 4 regional  national institutes for virology.  \\n \\nnutrition  \\n \\n31. to strengthen nutritional content, delivery, outreach, and outcome, \\nwe will merge the supplementary nutrition programme and the poshan \\nabhiyan and launch the mission poshan  2.0. we shall adopt an intensified \\nstrategy to improve nutritional outcomes across 112 aspirational districts.  \\n \\nuniversal coverage of water supply  \\n \\n32. the world health organisation has repeatedly stressed the \\nimportance of clean water, sanitation, and clean  environment, as a pre \\nrequisite to achieving universal health.  \\n \\n33. the jal jeevan mission (urban), will be launched.  it aims at universal \\nwater supply in all 4,37 8 urban local bodies with 2.86 crores  household tap \\nconnections, as well as liquid waste management in 500 amrut cities. it \\nwill be implemented over 5 years, with an outlay of `2,87,0 00 crores.  \\n \\nswachch bharat, swasth bharat  \\n \\n34. for further swachhta  of urban india, we intend to focus on complete  \\nfaecal sludge management and waste water treatment, source segregation \\nof garbage, reduction in single -use plastic, reduction in air pollution by \\neffectively managing waste from construction -and-demolition activities and \\nbio-remediation of all legacy dump  sites. the urban swachh bharat mission  \\n2.0 will be implemented with a total financial allocation of `1,41,678 crores \\nover a period of 5 years from 2021 -2026.  \\n \\nclean air  \\n \\n35. to tackle the burgeoning problem of  air pollution, i propose to \\nprovide an amount of `2,217 crores for 42 urban centres with a million -plus \\npopulation in this budget.  \\n 7 \\n \\n \\n scrapping policy  \\n \\n36. we are separately announcing a voluntary vehicle scrapping policy, \\nto phase out old and unfit vehicles. this will help in encouraging fuel -\\nefficient, environment friendly vehicles, thereby reducing vehicular \\npollution and oil import bill.  vehicles would u ndergo fitness tests in \\nautomated fitness centres after 20 years in case of personal vehicles, and \\nafter 15 years in case of commercial vehicles. details of the scheme will be \\nseparately shared by the ministry.  \\n \\nvaccines  \\n \\n37. the pneumococcal vaccine, a made in india product, is presently \\nlimited to only 5 states will be rolled out across the country. this will avert \\nmore than 50,000 child deaths annually.  \\n \\n38. i have provided `35,000 crores  for covid -19 vaccine in be 2021 -22. i \\nam committed to provide further funds if required.  \\n \\n39. the budget outlay for health and wellbeing  is `2,23,846 crores  in be \\n2021 -22 as against this year’s be of `94,452 crores  an increase of  137 \\npercentage. the details o f the same are at annexure i of  the speech.  \\n \\n2. physical and financial  capital and infrastructure  \\n \\natma nirbhar bharat – production linked incentive scheme (pli)  \\n \\n40. for a usd 5 trillion economy, our manufacturing sector has to grow \\nin double digits on a sustained basis. our manufacturing companies need to \\nbecome an integral par t of global supply chains, possess core competence \\nand cutting -edge technology. to achieve all of the above, pli schemes to \\ncreate manufacturing global champions for an atmanirbhar bharat have \\nbeen announced for 13 sectors.  for this, the government has co mmitted \\nnearly `1.97 lakh crores , over 5 years starting fy 2021 -22. this initiative will \\nhelp bring scale and size in key sectors, create and nurture global \\nchampions and provide jobs to our youth.   \\n \\n 8 \\n \\n \\n textiles  \\n \\n41. to enable the textile industry to become globally competitive, \\nattract large investments and boost employment generation, a scheme of \\nmega investment textiles parks (mitra)  will be launched in addition to the \\npli scheme. this will create world class infras tructure with plug and play \\nfacilities to enable create global champions in exports. 7 textile parks will \\nbe established over 3 years.  \\n \\ninfrastructure  \\n \\n42. the national infrastructure pipeline (nip) which i announced in \\ndecember 2019 is the first -of-its-kind, whole -of-government exercise ever \\nundertaken by government of india. the nip was launched with 6835 \\nprojects; the project pipeline has now expanded to 7 ,400 projects. around \\n217 projects worth `1.10 lakh crores under some key infrastructure \\nministries have been completed.  \\n \\n43. the nip is a specific target which this government is committed to \\nachieving over the coming years. it will require a major increase in funding \\nboth from the government and the financial sector. in this budget, i \\npropose to take concrete steps to do this, in three ways:  \\n \\n44. firstly, by creating the institutional structures; secondly, by a big \\nthrust on monetizing assets, and thirdly by enhancing the share of capital \\nexpenditure in central and state budgets.  \\n \\n \\ninfrastructure financing - development financial institution (dfi)  \\n \\n45. infrastructure needs long term debt financing. a professionally \\nmanaged development financial institution is necessary to act as a \\nprovider, enabler and catalyst for infrastructure financing. accordingly, i \\nshall introduce a bill to set up a dfi. i have pr ovided a sum of `20,000 crores \\nto capitalise this institution. the ambition is to have a lending portfolio of at \\nleast `5 lakh crores for this dfi in three years time.  \\n 9 \\n \\n \\n 46. debt financing of invits and reits by foreign portfolio investors will \\nbe enabled by ma king suitable amendments in the relevant legislations. this \\nwill further ease access of finance to invits and reits thus augmenting \\nfunds for infrastructure and real estate sectors.  \\n \\nasset monetisation  \\n \\n47. monetizing operating public infrastructure assets is a very important \\nfinancing option for new infrastructure construction. a “national \\nmonetization pipeline”  of potential brownfield infrastructure assets will be \\nlaunched.  an asset monetization dashboard will also be created for \\ntracking the progress and to provide visibility to investors. some important \\nmeasures in the direction of monetisation are:  \\n \\na. national highways authority of india and pgcil each have \\nsponsored one invit  that will attract international and domestic \\ninstitutional investors. five operational roads with an estimated \\nenterprise value of ` 5,000 crores are being transferred to the nhai \\ninvit.  similarily, transmission assets of a value of `7,000 crores will \\nbe transferred to the pgcil invit.  \\nb. railways will monetise dedicated freight corridor assets for \\noperations and maintenance, after commissioning.  \\nc. the next lot of airports will be monetised for operations and \\nmanagement concession.  \\nd. other core infrastructure assets that will be rolled out under the \\nasset monetization programme are: (i) nhai operational toll roads \\n(ii) transmission assets of pgcil (iii) oil and gas pipelines of gail, \\niocl and hpcl (iv) aai airports in tier ii and iii c ities, (v) other \\nrailway infrastructure assets (vi) warehousing assets of cpses such \\nas central warehousing corporation and nafed among others and \\n(vii) sports stadiums.  \\n  \\nsharp increase in capital budget  \\n \\n48. in the be 2020 -21, we had provided `4.12 lakh cror es for capital \\nexpenditure. it was our effort that in spite of resource crunch we should \\nspend more on capital and we are likely to end the year at around `4.39 10 \\n \\n \\n lakh crores which i have provided in the re 2020 -21.  for 2021 -22, i propose \\na sharp increase i n capital expenditure and thus have provided `5.54 lakh \\ncrores which is 34.5% more than the be of 2020 -21.  of this, i have kept a \\nsum of more than `44,000 crores in the budget head of the department of \\neconomic affairs to be provided for projects/programm es/departments \\nthat show good progress on capital expenditure and are in need of further \\nfunds. over and above this expenditure, we would also be providing more \\nthan `2 lakh crores to states and autonomous bodies for their capital \\nexpenditure.   \\n \\n49. we will a lso work out specific mechanisms to nudge states to spend \\nmore of their budget on creation of infrastructure.  \\n \\nroads and highways infrastructure  \\n \\n50. more than 13,000 km length of roads, at a cost of `3.3 lakh crores, \\nhas already been awarded under the `5.35 lakh crores bharatmala \\npariyojana project of which 3,800 kms have been constructed. by march \\n2022, we would be awarding another 8,500 kms and complete an additional \\n11,000 kms of national highway corridors.  \\n \\n51. to further augment road infrastructure, mor e economic corridors \\nare also being planned. some are:  \\n \\na. 3,500 km of national highway works in the state of tamil nadu at an \\ninvestment of `1.03 lakh crores. these include madurai -kollam \\ncorridor, chittoor -thatchur corridor. construction will start next \\nyear. \\nb. 1,100 km of national highway works in the state of kerala at an \\ninvestment of `65,000 crores including 600 km section of mumbai -\\nkanyakumari corridor in kerala.  \\nc. 675 km of highway works in the state of west bengal at a cost of \\n`25,000 crores  including upgradation of existing road -kolkata – \\nsiliguri.  \\nd. national highway works of around `19,000 crores  are currently in \\nprogress in the state of assam. further works of more than `34,000 11 \\n \\n \\n crores covering more than 1300 kms of national highways will be \\nundertaken in the state in the coming three years.  \\n \\n52. some of the flagship corridors and other important projects that \\nwould see considerable activity in 2021 -22 are in annexure -ii.   \\n \\n53. i am also providing an enhanced outlay of `1,18,101 lakh crores for \\nministry of roa d transport and highways, of which `1,08,230 crores is for \\ncapital, the highest ever.  \\n \\nrailway infrastructure  \\n \\n54. indian railways have prepared a national rail plan for india – 2030. \\nthe plan is to create a ‘future ready’ railway system by 2030.  \\n \\n55. bringing down the logistic costs for our industry is at the core of our \\nstrategy to enable ‘make in india’. it is expected that western dedicated \\nfreight corridor (dfc) and eastern dfc will be commissioned by june 2022. \\nthe following additional initiatives are prop osed:  \\n \\na. the sonnagar – gomoh section (263.7 km) of eastern dfc will be \\ntaken up in ppp mode in 2021 -22. gomoh -dankuni section of 274.3 \\nkm will also be taken up in short succession.  \\nb.  we will undertake future dedicated freight corridor projects namely \\neast co ast corridor from kharagpur to vijayawada, east -west \\ncorridor from bhusaval to kharagpur to dankuni and north -south \\ncorridor from itarsi to vijayawada. detailed project reports will be \\nundertaken in the first phase.    \\nc. broad gauge route kilometers (rkm) el ectrified is expected to reach \\n46,000 rkm i.e., 72% by end of 2021 from 41,548 rkm on 1st oct \\n2020 . 100% electrification of broad -gauge routes will be completed \\nby december, 2023.  \\n \\n56. for passenger convenience and safety the following measures are \\nproposed:  12 \\n \\n \\n a. we will introduce the aesthetically designed vista dome lhb coach \\non tourist routes to give a better travel experience to passengers.   \\nb. the safety measures undertaken in the past few years have borne \\nresults. to further strengthen this effort, high density  network and \\nhighly utilized network routes of indian railways will be provided \\nwith an indigenously developed automatic train protection system  \\nthat eliminates train collision due to human error.  \\nc. i am providing a record sum of `1,10,055 crores , for railways of \\nwhich `1,07,100 crores  is for capital expenditure.  \\n \\nurban infrastructure  \\n57. we will work towards raising the share of public transport in urban \\nareas through expansion of metro rail network and augmentation of city bus \\nservice. a new scheme will be launched at a cost of `18,000 crores  to \\nsupport augmentation of public bus transport services. the scheme will \\nfacilitate deployment of innovative ppp models to enable private sector \\nplayers to finance, acquire, operate and maintain over 20,000 buses.  the \\nscheme will boost the automobile se ctor, provide fillip to economic growth, \\ncreate employment opportunities for our youth and enhance ease of \\nmobility for urban residents.  \\n \\n58. a total of 702 km of conventional metro is operational and another \\n1,016 km of metro and rrts is under construction i n 27 cities. two new \\ntechnologies i.e., ‘metrolite’ and

giga watts of installed capacity, \\nconnected an additional 2.8 crores  households and added 1.41 lakh circuit \\nkm of transmission lines.  \\n \\n61. the distribution  companies across the country are monopolies ,  \\neither government or private. there is a need to provide choice to \\nconsumers by promoting competition. a framework will be put in place to \\ngive consumers alternatives to choose from among more than one \\ndistrib ution company.  \\n \\n62. the viability of distribution companies is a serious concern. a \\nrevamped reforms -based result -linked power distribution sector scheme \\nwill be launched with an outlay of `3,05,984 crores   over 5 years. the \\nscheme will provide assistance to discoms for infrastructure creation \\nincluding pre -paid smart metering

this initiative will enable greater training and 14 \\n \\n \\n employment opportunities for indian seafarers besides enhancing indian \\ncompanies share in global shipping.  \\n \\n66. india has enacted recycling of ships act, 2019 and acceded to the \\nhong kong international convention.  around 90 ship recycling yards at \\nalang in gujarat have already achieved hkc -compliant certificates. efforts \\nwill be made to bring more ships to india fr om europe and japan. recycling \\ncapacity of around 4.5 million light displacement tonne (ldt) will be \\ndoubled by 2024. this is expected to generate an additional 1.5 lakh jobs for \\nour youth.  \\n \\npetroleum & natural gas  \\n \\n67. our government has kept fuel supplies r unning across the country \\nwithout interruption during the covid -19 lockdown period. taking note of \\nthe crucial nature of this sector in people’s lives, the following key initiatives \\nare being announced:  \\n \\na. ujjwala scheme which has benefited 8 crores  households will be \\nextended to cover  1 crores  more beneficiaries . \\nb. we will add 100 more districts in next 3 years to the city gas \\ndistribution network.   \\nc. a gas pipeline

capacity \\nin all -natural gas pipelines on a non -discriminatory open access \\nbasis.  \\n \\nfinancial capital  \\n68. i propose to consolidate the pro visions of sebi act, 1992, \\ndepositories act, 1996, securities contracts (regulation) act, 1956 and \\ngovernment securities act, 2007 into a rationalized single securities \\nmarkets code .   \\n   \\n 15 \\n \\n \\n 69. the government would support the development of a world class \\nfin-tech hub at the gift -ifsc.  \\n \\n70. to instill confidence amongst the participants in the corporate bond \\nmarket during times of stress and to generally enhance secondary market \\nliquidity, it is proposed to create a permanent institutional framework.  the \\npropo sed body would purchase investment grade debt securities both in \\nstressed and normal times and help in the development of the bond \\nmarket.   \\n \\n71. in the budget of 2018 -19, government had announced its intent to \\nestablish a system of regulated gold exchanges in  the country. for the \\npurpose, sebi will be notified as the regulator and warehousing \\ndevelopment and regulatory authority will be strengthened to set up a \\ncommodity market eco system arrangement including vaulting, assaying, \\nlogistics etc in addition to w arehousing.  \\n \\n72. towards investor protection, i propose to introduce an investor \\ncharter as a right of all financial investors across all financial products.  \\n \\n73. to give a further boost to the non -conventional energy sector, i \\npropose to provide additional capi tal infusion of `1,000 crores  to solar \\nenergy corporation of india and `1,500 crores  to indian renewable energy \\ndevelopment agency.   \\n \\nincreasing fdi in insurance sector  \\n \\n74. i propose to amend the insurance act, 1938 to increase the \\npermissible fdi  limit from 49% to 74% in insurance companies and allow \\nforeign  ownership and control with safeguards . under the new structure, \\nthe majority of directors on the board and key management persons would \\nbe resident indians, with at least 50% of directors being independent \\ndirectors, and specified percentage of profits being retained as general \\nreserve.  \\n \\nstres sed asset resolution by setting up a new structure  \\n \\n75. the high level of provisioning by public sector banks of their stressed \\nassets calls for measures to clean up the bank books.  an asset 16 \\n \\n \\n reconstruction company limited and asset management company would \\nbe set up to consolidate and take over the existing  stressed debt and then \\nmanage and dispose of the assets to alternate investment funds and other \\npotential investors for eventual value realization.  \\n \\nrecapitalization of psbs  \\n \\n76. to further consolidate the financial capacity of psbs , further \\nrecapitalization of `20,000 crores  is proposed in 2021 -22. \\n \\ndeposit insurance  \\n \\n77. last year, government had approved an increase in the deposit \\ninsurance cover from `1 lakh to `5 lakhs for bank customers. i shall be \\nmoving amendments to the dicgc act, 1961 in this session itself to \\nstreamline the provisions, so that if a bank is temporarily unable to fulfil its \\nobligations, the depositors of such a bank can get easy and time -boun d \\naccess to their deposits to the extent of the deposit insurance cover. this \\nwould help depositors of banks that are currently under stress.  \\n \\n78. to improve credit discipline while continuing to protect the interest \\nof small borrowers, for nbfcs with minimum asset size of `100 crores, the \\nminimum loan size eligible for debt recovery under the securitisation and \\nreconstruction of financial assets and enforcement of security interest \\n(sarfaesi) act, 2002 is proposed to be reduced from the existing level of \\n`50 lakhs to `20 lakhs.  \\n \\ncompany matters  \\n \\n79. the decriminalizing of the procedural and technical compoundable \\noffences under the companies act, 2013, is now complete. i now propose \\nto next take up decriminalization of the limited liability partnership (llp) \\nact, 2 008.  \\n \\n80. sir, i propose to revise the definition under the companies act, 2013 \\nfor small companies by increasing their thresholds for paid up capital from \\n“not exceeding `50 lakh” to “not exceeding `2 crore” and turnover from \\n“not exceeding `2 crore ” to “not exceeding `20 c rore ”. this will benefit 17 \\n \\n \\n more than two lakh companies in easing their compliance requirements.  \\n \\n81. as a further measure which directly benefits start -ups and \\ninnovators, i propose to incentivize the incorporation of one person \\ncompanies ( opcs) by allowing opcs to grow without any restrictions on \\npaid up capital and turnover, allowing their conversion into any other type \\nof company at any time, reducing the residency limit for an indian citizen to \\nset up an opc from 182 days to 120 days and  also allow non resident \\nindians (nris) to incorporate opcs in india.  \\n \\n82. to ensure faster resolution of cases, nclt framework will be \\nstrengthened, e -courts system shall be implemented and alternate \\nmethods of debt resolution and special framework for msmes  shall be \\nintroduced.  \\n \\n83. during the coming fiscal 2021 -22, we  will be launching  data \\nanalytics, artificial intelligence, machine learning driven mca21 version 3.0. \\nthis version 3.0 will have additional modules for e -scrutiny, e -adjudication, \\ne-consultation and compliance management.  \\n \\ndisinvestment and strategic sale  \\n \\n84. in spite of covid -19, we have kept working towards strategic \\ndisinvestment. a number of transactions namely bpcl, air india, shipping \\ncorporation of india, container corporation of india, idbi  bank, beml, \\npawan hans, neelachal ispat nigam limited among others would be \\ncompleted in 2021 -22. other than idbi bank, we propose to take up the \\nprivatization of two public sector banks and one general insurance \\ncompany in the year 2021 -22.  this would r equire legislative amendments \\nand i propose to introduce the amendments in this session itself.  \\n \\n85. in 2021 -22 we would also bring the ipo of lic for which i am \\nbringing the requisite amendments in this session itself.   \\n \\n86. in the atmanirbhar package, i had ann ounced that we will come out \\nwith a policy of strategic disinvestment of public sector enterprises.  i am \\nhappy to inform the house that the government has approved the said \\npolicy.  the policy provides a clear roadmap for disinvestment in all non -\\nstrategi c and strategic sectors.  we have kept four areas that are strategic 18 \\n \\n \\n where bare minimum cpses will be maintained and rest privatized. in the \\nremaining sectors all cpses will be privatized. the main highlights of the \\npolicy are mentioned at annexure -iii. \\n \\n87. to fast forward the disinvestment policy, i am asking niti to work \\nout on the next list of central public sector companies that would be taken \\nup for strategic disinvestment.  \\n \\n88. to similarly incentivise states to take to disinvestment of their public \\nsector companies, we will work out an incentive package of central funds \\nfor states.  \\n \\n89. idle assets will not contribute to atmanirbhar bharat. the non -core \\nassets largely consist of surplus land with government \\nministries/departments and public sector enterprises. monetizing of land \\ncan either be by way of direct sale or concession or by similar means. this \\nrequires special abilities and for this purpose, i propose to use a special \\npurpose vehicle in the form of a company that would carry out this activity.  \\n \\n90. in orde r to ensure timely completion of closure of sick or loss \\nmaking cpses, we will introduce a revised mechanism that will ensure \\ntimely closure of such units.  \\n \\n91. i have estimated ` 1,75,000 crores as receipts from disinvestment  in \\nbe 202 1-22. \\n \\ngovernment financial reforms  \\n \\n92. under the treasury single account (tsa) system autonomous bodies \\ndirectly draw funds from the government’s account at the time of actual \\nexpenditure, saving interest costs. we will extend the tsa system for \\nuniversal application from 202 1-22. \\n \\n93. on the recommendation of the fifteenth finance commission, we \\nhave undertaken a detailed exercise to rationalise and bring down the \\nnumber of centra lly sponsored schemes. this will enable consolidation of \\noutlays for better impact.  \\n 19 \\n \\n \\n 94. the government i s committed to the development of multi -state \\ncooperatives and will provide all support to them. to further streamline the \\n‘ease of doing business’ for cooperatives, i propose to set up a separate \\nadministrative structure for them.  \\n \\n3. inclusive development for aspirational india  \\n \\n95. honourable speaker sir, under this pillar, i will cover agriculture and \\nallied sectors, farmers’ welfare and rural india, migrant workers and labour, \\nand financial inclusion.  \\n \\nagriculture  \\n \\n96. our government is committed to the welfare of farmers.  the msp \\nregime has undergone a sea change to assure price that is at least 1.5 times \\nthe cost of production across all commodities. the procurement has also \\ncontinued to increase at a steady pace.  this has resulted in increase in \\npayment to farmers substantially.  \\n \\n97. in case of wheat, the total amount paid to farmers in 2013 -2014 was \\n`33,874 crores. in 2019 -2020 it was `62,802 crores , and even better, in \\n2020 -2021, this amount, paid to farmers, was `75,060 crores.  the number \\nof wheat  growing farmers that were benefitted increased in 2020 -21 to \\n43.36 lakhs as compared to 35.57 lakhs in 2019 -20. \\n \\n98. for paddy, the amount paid in 2013 -14 was `63,928 crores. in 2019 -\\n2020 this increased `1,41,930 crores . even better, in 2020 -2021, this is \\nfurther estimated to increase to `172,752 crores.  the number of farmers \\nbenefitted increased from 1.24 crores in 2019 -20 to 1.54 crores in 2020 -21.   \\n \\n99. in the same vein, in case of pulses, the amount paid in 2013 -2014 \\nwas `236 crores. in 2019 -20 it increased `8,285 crores. now, in 2020 -2021, \\nit is at `10,530 crores, a more than 40 times increase from 2013 -14.  \\n \\n100. the receipts to cotton farmers have seen a stupendous increase \\nfrom `90 crores  in 2013 -14 to `25,974 crores  (as on 27th january 2021).  \\nthe details are in annexure iv.  \\n 20 \\n \\n \\n 101. early this year, honourable prime minister had launched swamitva \\nscheme. under this, a record of rights is being given to property owners in \\nvillages. up till now, about 1.80 lakh property -owne rs in 1,241 villages have \\nbeen provided cards. i now propose during fy21 -22 to extend this to cover \\nall states/uts.  \\n \\n102. to provide adequate credit to our farmers, i have enhanced the \\nagricultural credit target to `16.5 lakh crores in fy22. we will focus on \\nensuring increased credit flows to animal husbandry, dairy, and fisheries.  \\n \\n103. we are enhancing the allocation to the rural infrastructure \\ndevelopment fund from `30,000 crores to `40,000 crores.  \\n \\n104. the micro irrigation fund, with a corpus of `5,000 crores has be en \\ncreated under nabard, i propose to double it by augmenting it by another \\n`5,000 crores.  \\n \\n105. to boost value addition in agriculture and allied products and their \\nexports, the scope of ‘operation green scheme’ that is presently applicable \\nto tomatoes, onions, and potatoes, will be enlarged to include 22 perishable \\nproducts.  \\n \\n106. around 1.68 crores  farmers are registered and ` 1.14 lakh crores  of \\ntrade value has been carried out through e -nams. keeping in view the \\ntransparency and competitiveness that e -nam has brought into the \\nagricultural market, 1,000 more mandis will be integrated with e -nam.  \\n  \\n107. the agriculture infrastructure fund  would be made available to \\napmcs for augmenting their infrastructure facilities.  \\n \\nfisheries  \\n \\n108. i am proposing substantial investments in the development of \\nmodern fishing harbours and fish landing centres. to start with, 5 maj or \\nfishing harbours – kochi, chennai, visakhapatnam, paradip, and petuaghat – \\nwill be developed as hubs of economic activity. we will also develop inland \\nfishing harbours and fish -landing centres along the banks of rivers and \\nwaterways.  \\n 21 \\n \\n \\n 109. seaweed farming i s an emerging sector with potential to transform \\nthe lives of coastal communities .  it will provide large scale employment and \\nadditional incomes. to promote seaweed cultivation, i propose a \\nmultipurpose seaweed park to be established in tamil nadu.  \\n \\nmigr ant workers and labourers  \\n \\n110. we have launched the one nation one ration card scheme through \\nwhich beneficiaries can claim their rations anywhere in the country . \\nmigrant workers in particular benefit from this scheme – those staying away \\nfrom their families can partially claim their ration where they are stationed, \\nwhile their family, in their native places, can claim the rest. i  am happy to \\ninform you that one nation one ration card plan is under implementation \\nby 32 states and uts, reaching about 69 crores  beneficiaries – that’s a total \\nof 86% beneficiaries covered. the remaining 4 states and uts will be \\nintegrated in the next few months.  \\n \\n111. to further extend our efforts toward s the unorganised labour force  \\nmigrant workers particularly,  i propose to launch a portal that will collect \\nrelevant information on gig, building, and construction -workers among \\nothers. this will help formulate health, housing, skill, insurance, credit, and \\nfood schemes for migrant workers.  \\n \\n112. we will conclude a proc ess that began 20 years ago, with the \\nimplementation of the 4 labour codes. for the first time globally, social \\nsecurity benefits will extend to gig and platform workers. minimum wages \\nwill apply to all categories of workers, and they will all be covered b y the \\nemployees state insurance corporation. women will be allowed to work in \\nall categories and also in the night -shifts with adequate protection. at the \\nsame time, compliance burden on employers will be reduced with single \\nregistration and licensing, and  online returns.  \\n \\nfinancial inclusion  \\n \\n113. to further facilitate credit flow under the scheme of stand up india \\nfor scs, sts, and women, i propose to reduce the margin money \\nrequirement from 25% to 15%, and to also include loans for activities allied \\nto agricu lture.  22 \\n \\n \\n  \\n114. we have taken a number of steps to support the msme sector. in \\nthis budget, i have provided `15,700 crores to this sector , more than double \\nof this year’s be.  \\n \\n4. reinvigorating human capital  \\n \\n115. the national education policy (nep) announced recently  has had \\ngood reception.  \\n \\nschool education  \\n \\n116. more than 15,000 schools will be qualitatively strengthened to \\ninclude all components of the national education policy. they shall emerge \\nas exemplar schools

schools/states.  \\n \\nhigher education  \\n \\n118. in budget 2019 -20, i had mentioned about the setting -up of higher \\neducation commission of india. we would be introducing legislation this \\nyear to implement the same. it will be an umbrella body having 4 separate \\nvehicles for standard -setting, accreditation , regulation, and funding.  \\n \\n119. many of our cities have various research institutions, universities, \\nand colleges supported by the government of india. hyderabad for \\nexample, has about 40 such major institutions. in 9 such cities, we will \\ncreate formal umbrel la structures so that these institutions can have better \\nsynergy, while also retaining their internal autonomy. a glue grant will be \\nset aside for this purpose.  \\n \\n120. for accessible higher education in ladakh, i propose to set up a \\ncentral university in leh.  \\n \\n121. the other important projects to be taken up as part o f nep are listed \\nat annexure v . 23 \\n \\n \\n  \\nscheduled castes and scheduled tribes welfare  \\n \\n122. we have set ourselves a target of establishing 750 eklavya model \\nresidential schools in our tribal areas. i propose to incr ease the unit cost of \\neach such school from `20 crores to `38 crores, and for hilly and difficult \\nareas, to `48 crores. this would help in creating robust infrastructure \\nfacilities for our tribal students.  \\n \\n123. we have revamped the post matric scholarship scheme, for the \\nwelfare of scheduled castes. i  have also enhanced the central assistance in \\nthis regard . we are allotting ` 35,219 crores for 6 years till 2025 -2026, to \\nbenefit 4 crores  sc students.  \\n \\nskilling  \\n \\n124. in 2016, we had launched the national apprenti ceship promotion \\nscheme. the government proposes to amend the apprenticeship act with a \\nview to further enhancing apprenticeship opportunities for our youth. we \\nwill realign the existing scheme of national apprenticeship training scheme \\n(nats) for providin g post -education apprenticeship, training of graduates \\nand diploma holders in engineering. over `3,000 crores will be provided for \\nthis.  \\n \\n125. an

workforce. we \\nalso have a collaborative training inter training programme (titp) between \\nindia and japan to facilitate transfer of japanese industrial and vocational \\nskills, technique, and knowledge.  we will take forward this initiative with \\nmany more countries.  \\n \\n5. innovation and r&d  \\n \\n126. in my budget speech of july 2019, i had announced the national \\nresearch foundation. we have now worked out the modalities  and the nrf \\noutlay will be of `50,000 crores, over 5 years. it will ensure that the overall 24 \\n \\n \\n research ecosystem of the country is strengthened with focus on identified \\nnational -priority thrust areas.  \\n \\n127. there has been a manifold increase in digital payments in the recent \\npast. to give a fu rther boost to digital transactions, i earmark `1,500 crores \\nfor a proposed scheme that will provide financial incentive to promote \\ndigital modes of payment.  \\n \\n128. we will undertake a new initiative – national language translation \\nmission (ntlm). this will enab le the wealth of governance -and-policy \\nrelated knowledge on the internet being made available in major indian \\nlanguages.  \\n \\n129. the new space india limited (nsil), a psu under the department of \\nspace will execute the pslv -cs51 launch, carrying the amazonia sate llite \\nfrom brazil, along with a few smaller indian satellites.  \\n \\n130. as part of the gaganyaan mission activities, four indian astronauts \\nare being trained on generic space flight aspects, in russia. the first \\nunmanned launch is slated for december 2021.  \\n \\n131. our oc eans are a storehouse of living and non -living resources. to \\nbetter understand this realm, we will launch a deep ocean mission with a \\nbudget outlay of more than `4,000 crores , over five years. this mission will \\ncover deep ocean survey exploration and proje cts for the conservation of \\ndeep sea bio -diversity.  \\n \\n6.  minimum government, maximum governance  \\n132. speaker sir, i now come to the last of the six pillars. this will outline \\nplans for reforms in one of our core principles of minimum gover nment , \\nmaximum govern ance.  \\n \\n133. we have taken a number of steps to bring reforms in tribunals in \\nthe last few years for speedy delivery of justice. continuing with the \\nreforms process, i now  propose to take  further measures to rationalize the \\nfunctioning of tribunals.  \\n \\n134. we have introduced the national commission for allied healthcare \\nprofessionals bill in parliament, with a view to ensure transparent and 25 \\n \\n \\n efficient regulation of the 56 allied healthcare professions. additionally, to \\nbring about transparency, efficiency and  governance reforms in the nursing \\nprofession, the national nursing and midwifery commission bill will be \\nintroduced by the government for passing.  \\n \\n135. to have ease of doing business for those who deal with government \\nor cpses, and carry out contracts, i prop ose to set up a conciliation \\nmechanism and mandate its use for quick resolution of contractual \\ndisputes. this will instil confidence in private investors and contractors.  \\n \\n136. the forthcoming census could be the first digital census in the \\nhistory of india. fo r this monumental and milestone -marking task, i have \\nallocated `3,76 8 crores  in the year 2021 -2022.  \\n \\n137. goa is celebrating the diamond jubilee year of the state’s liberation \\nfrom portuguese rule. from the goi’s side, i propose a grant of `300 crores \\nto the go vernment of goa for the celebrations.  \\n \\n138. i propose to provide `1,000 crores for the welfare of tea workers \\nespecially women and their children in assam and west bengal. a special \\nscheme will be devised for the same.  \\n \\n \\nfiscal position  \\n \\n139. in these last few paragraphs of part a of my speech, i draw the \\nattention of this august house to the fact that, at the beginning of the \\ncurrent financial year, the pandemic’s impact on the economy resulted in a \\nweak revenue inflow. this was combined with high expenditure t o provide \\nessential relief to vulnerable sections of the society especially the poor, \\nwomen, scs and sts.  \\n \\n140.  unlike many other countries, we opted for a series of medium -sized \\npackages during the pandemic so that we could calibrate and target our \\nresponse a ccording to an evolving situation. once the health situation \\nstabilised, and the lockdown was being slowly lifted, we switched to \\nramping up government spending so as to revive domestic demand. as a \\nresult, against an original be expenditure of `30.42 lakh  crores for 2020 -\\n2021, our re estimates are `34.50 lakh crores. we have maintained the 26 \\n \\n \\n quality of expenditure. the capital expenditure, estimated in re is ` 4.39 \\nlakh crores in 2020 -2021 as against `4.12 lakh crores in b e 2020 -21. \\n \\n141. the fiscal deficit in re  2020 -21 is pegged at 9.5%  of gdp . we have \\nfunded this through government borrowings, multilateral borrowings, small \\nsaving funds and short term borrowings. we would need another ` 80,000 \\ncrores  for which we would be approaching the markets in these 2 months. \\nto ensure that the economy is given the required push, our be estimates for \\nexpenditure in 2021 -2022, are `34.83  lakh crores. this includes ` 5.54 lakh \\ncrores as capital expenditure, an incr ease of  34.5 % over the be figure of \\n2020 -2021. the fiscal deficit in be 2021 -2022 is estimated to be 6.8% of \\ngdp.  the gross borrowing from the market for the next year would be \\naround `12 lakh crores. we plan to continue with our path of fiscal \\nconsolidati on, and intend to reach a fiscal deficit level below 4.5% of gdp by \\n2025 -2026 with a fairly steady decline over the period. we hope to achieve \\nthe consolidation by first, increasing the buoyancy of tax revenue through \\nimproved compliance, and secondly , by increased receipts from \\nmonetisation of assets, including public sector enterprises and land.  the \\ncontingency fund of india is being proposed to be augmented from `500 \\ncrores  to `30,000 crores  through finance bill.  \\n  \\n \\n142. in accordance with the views of the 15th finance commission, we \\nare allowing a normal ceiling of net borrowing for the states at 4% of gsdp \\nfor the year 2021 -2022. a portion of this ceiling will be earmarked to be \\nspent on incremental capital expenditure. additional borrowing ceiling of \\n0.5% o f gsdp will also be provided subject to conditions. states will be \\nexpected to reach a fiscal deficit of 3% of gsdp by 2023 -24, as \\nrecommended by the 15th finance commission.  \\n \\n143.  in the july 2019 -2020 budget, i introduced the statement 27 on \\nextra budgetary resources – it disclosed the borrowings of government \\nagencies that went towards funding goi schemes, and whose repayment \\nburden was on the government. in my 2020 -2021 budget, i enhanced the \\nscope and coverage of the statement, by including the loans provi ded by \\ngovernment to the fci. taking a step further in this direction , i   propose  to \\ndiscontinue the nssf loan to fci for food subsidy and accordingly budget \\nprovisions have been made in re 2020-21 and be 2021 -22. the extra \\nbudgetary resources details are  at annexure vi.  27 \\n \\n \\n 144. we know that the frbm act mandates fiscal deficit of 3% of gdp to \\nbe achieved by 31st march 2020 -2021. the effect of this year’s unforeseen \\nand unprecedented circumstances has necessitated the submission of a \\ndeviation statement under sect ions 4 (5) and 7 (3) (b) of the frbm act \\nwhich i am laying on the table of the house as part of the frbm \\ndocuments.  \\n \\n145. towards achieving central government fiscal deficit along the broad \\npath that i have already indicated; i will be introducing an amendment to \\nthe frbm act.  \\n \\n146. on 9th december 2020, the 15th finance commission submitted its \\nfinal report, covering the period 2021 -2026 to the rashtrapati ji. the \\ngovernment has laid the commission’s report, along with the explanatory \\nmemorandum in the parliament retaining the vertical shares of the states at \\n41%. we recognise our commitment to fiscal federalism and propose \\ntherefore to adhere to this recommendation. jammu and kashmir in the \\n14th finance commission was entitled to get devolution being a state. now,  \\nthe funds to the uts of jammu and kashmir and ladakh would be provided \\nby the centre.  i have also provided, on the commission’s recommendation, \\n`1,18,452 crores as revenue deficit grant to 17 states in 2021 -2022, as \\nagainst `74,340 crores to  14 s tates in 2020 -2021.  \\n \\ni would, now, move to part b of my speech.  28 \\n \\npart b  \\n147. honourable speaker, the world is facing a serious challenge of the \\npandemic and its aftershock. in these trying times, when many economies \\nare struggling to revive, our people and our industry have exhibited \\nremarkable resilience.  \\n \\n148. as i mentioned already, post -pandemic, a new world order seems to \\nbe emerging, one in which asia is poised to occupy a prominent position \\nand india will have a leading role therein.  in this scenario, our tax system \\nhas to be transparent, efficient, and sh ould promote investments and \\nemployment in our country. at the same time it should put minimum \\nburden on our tax payers.  \\n \\nஇய\\x82ற´\\x7f ஈyட´u கா{த´\\x7f கா{த

\\n \\ndirect tax proposals  \\n149. keeping this in mind, our government introduced a series of reforms \\nin the direct tax system for the benefit of our taxpayers and economy.  few \\nmonths prior to the pandemic,   in order to attract investments  we slashed \\nour corporate tax rate to make it among the lowest in the world. the \\ndividend distribution tax too was abolished. the burden of taxation on \\nsmall taxpayers was eased by increasing rebates. in 2020, the return f ilers \\nsaw a dramatic increase to  6.48 crore from  3.31 crore in 2014.  \\n \\n150. in the direct tax administration, we had recently introduced the \\nfaceless assessment and faceless appeal. i now seek to take further steps \\nto simplify the tax administration, ease compliance, and reduce litigation.  \\n 29 \\n \\nrelief to senior citizens  \\n151. i begin my direct tax proposals by offering my pranaam  to our senior \\ncitizens. many of them, despite having foregone several basic necessities of \\ntheir own, have strived to build our nation.  \\n \\n152. now in the 75th year of independence of our country, when we \\ncontinue our  endeavour with renewed vigour, we shall reduce compliance \\nburden on our senior citizens who are 75 years of age and above. for senior \\ncitizens who only have pension and interest incom e, i propose exemption \\nfrom filing their income tax returns. the paying bank will deduct the \\nnecessary tax on their income.   \\n \\nreduction in time for income tax proceedings  \\n153. honourable speaker, presently, an assessment can be re -opened up \\nto 6 years and in serious tax fraud cases for up to 10 years. as a result, \\ntaxpayers have to remain under uncertainty for a long time.  \\n \\n154. i therefore propose to reduce this time -limit for re -opening of \\nassessment to 3 years from the present 6 years. in serious tax evasion cases \\ntoo, only where there is evidence of concealment of income of  `50 lakh or \\nmore in a year, can the assessment be re -opened up to 10 years. even this \\nreopening can be don e only after the approval of the principal chief \\ncommissioner, the highest level of the income tax department.  \\n \\nsetting up the dispute resolution committee  \\n155. honourable speaker, it has been the resolve of this government to \\nreduce litigation, which mars the  present taxation system.   \\n \\n156. the government came out with the direct tax vivad se vishwas \\nscheme to give taxpayers an opportunity to settle long pending disputes \\nand be relieved of further strain on their time and resources. the response  \\nfrom the taxpayer s has been the best ever as  over 1 lakh ten thousand  \\ntaxpayers have already opted to settle tax disputes of over  `85,000 crores  \\nunder this scheme.  \\n \\n 30 \\n \\n157. to further reduce litigation for small taxpayers, i propose to \\nconstitute a dispute resolution committee  for them , which will be faceless \\nto ensure efficiency, transparency and accountability. anyone with a taxable \\nincome up to  `50 lakh and disputed income up to  `10 lakh shall be eligible \\nto approach the committee.  \\n \\nfaceless itat  \\n158. for ease of compliance and to reduce discretion, we  are committed \\nto make the taxation processes faceless . the government has already \\nintroduced faceless assessment and appeal this year.  \\n \\n159. the next level of income tax appeal is the income tax appellate \\ntribunal.  i now propose to make this tribunal faceless. we shall establish a \\nnational faceless income tax appellate tribunal centre. all communication \\nbetween the tribunal and the appellant shall be electronic. where personal \\nhearing is needed, it shall be d one through video -conferencing.  \\n \\nrelaxation to nri  \\n160. when non -resident indians return to india, they have issues with \\nrespect to their accrued incomes in their foreign retirement accounts. this \\nis usually due to a mismatch in taxation periods.  they also f ace difficulties \\nin getting credit for indian taxes in foreign jurisdictions. i propose t o notify \\nrules for removing their  hardship of double taxation.  \\n \\nexemption from audit  \\n161. currently, if your turnover exceeds  `1 crore, you have to get your \\naccounts audi ted. in the february 2020 budget, i had increased the limit for \\ntax audit to  `5 crore for those who carry out 95% of their transactions \\ndigitally. to further incentivise digital transactions and reduce compliance \\nburden, i propose to increase this limit f or tax audit for such persons from  \\n`5 crore to  `10 crore.  \\nrelief for dividend  \\n162. in the previous budget, i had abolished the dividend distribution tax \\n(ddt) in order to incentivise investment. dividend was made taxable in the 31 \\n \\nhands of shareholders. now, in order to provide ease of compliance, i \\npropose to make dividend payment to reit/ invit exempt from tds. \\nfurther, as the amount of dividend income cannot be estimated correctly \\nby the shareholders for paying advance tax, i propose to provide that \\nadvance ta x liability on dividend income shall arise only after the \\ndeclaration/payment of dividend. also, for foreign portfolio investors, i \\npropose to enable deduction of tax on dividend income at lower treaty rate.  \\nattracting foreign investment into infrastructu re sector  \\n163. in the last budget, for attracting foreign investment in the \\ninfrastructure sector, we had granted 100% tax exemption, subject to \\ncertain conditions, to foreign sovereign wealth funds and pension funds, \\non their income from investment in indian i nfras tructure. we have noticed \\nthat few of such funds are facing difficulties in meeting some of these \\nconditions. in order to ensure that a large number of funds invest in india, i \\npropose to relax some of these conditions relating to prohibition on priva te \\nfunding, restriction on commercial activities, and direct investment in \\ninfrastructure.     \\n \\n164. in order to allow funding of infrastructure by issue of zero coupon \\nbonds, i propose to make notified infrastructure debt funds eligible to raise \\nfunds by issui ng tax efficient zero coupon bonds.  \\n \\naffordable housing/rental housing  \\n165. this government sees ‘housing for all’ and affordable housing as \\npriority areas. in the july 2019 budget , i provided an additional deduction of \\ninterest, amounting to  `1.5 lakh, for loan taken to purchase an affordable \\nhouse. i propose to extend the eligibility of this deduction by one more \\nyear, to 31st march 2022. the additional deduction of  `1.5 lakh shall \\ntherefore be available for loans taken up till 31st march 202 2, for the \\npurchase of an affordable house.  \\n \\n166. further, to keep up the supply of affordable houses, i propose that \\naffordable housing projects can avail a tax holiday for one more year – till \\n31st march, 2022.  \\n 32 \\n \\n167. we are committed to promote supply of affordable rental housing \\nfor migrant workers. for this, i propose to allow  tax exemption for notified \\naffordable rental housing projects.  \\n \\ntax incentives to ifsc  \\n168. as i mentioned in part a of this speech, the government is \\ncommitted t o make the international financial services centre (ifsc) in gift \\ncity a global financial hub. in addition to the tax incentives already \\nprovided, i propose to include, among others, tax holiday for capital gains \\nfor aircraft leasing companies, tax exempti on for aircraft lease rentals paid \\nto foreign lessors; tax incentive for relocating foreign funds in the ifsc; and \\nto  allow tax exemption to the investment division of foreign banks located \\nin ifsc.  \\npre-filling of returns  \\n169. honourable speaker, in order to ease compliance for the taxpayer, \\ndetails of salary income, tax payments, tds, etc. already come pre -filled in  \\nincome tax  returns. to further ease filing of returns, details of capital gains \\nfrom listed securities, dividend income, and interest from banks,  post office, \\netc. will also be pre -filled.  \\n \\nrelief to small trusts  \\n170. we hope to reduce compliance burden on small  charitable trusts \\nrunning  educational institutions and hospitals. so far, there is a blanket \\nexemption to such entities, whose annual receipt  does not exceed   \\n`1 crore. i now propose to increase this amount to  `5 crore.  \\n \\nlabour welfare  \\n171. we have noticed that some employers deduct the contribution of \\nemployees towards  provident  funds, superannuation funds,  and other \\nsocial security funds but do not deposit these contributions within the \\nspecified time. for the employees, this means a loss of interest or income. \\nin cases where an employer later becomes financial ly unviable, non -deposit \\nresults in a permanent loss for the employees.  33 \\n \\n172. in order to ensure that employees’ contributions are deposited on \\ntime, i reiterate that the late deposit of employee’s contribution by the \\nemployer will not be allowed as deduction to the employer.  \\n \\nincentives for start -ups \\n173. in order to incentivise  start -ups in the country, i propose to extend \\nthe eligibility for claiming tax holiday for start -ups by one more year - till \\n31st march, 2022. further, in order to incentivise funding of the start -ups, i \\npropose to extend the capital gains exemption for investment in start -ups \\nby one more year - till 31st march, 2022.  \\nindirect tax proposals  \\ngst  \\n174. before i come to my indirect tax proposals, i would like to appraise \\nthe house on gst. the gst is now four years ol d, and we have taken several \\nmeasures to further simplify it. some of the measures include:  \\ni. nil return through sms,  \\nii. quarterly return and monthly payment for small taxpayers,  \\niii. electronic invoice system,  \\niv. validated input tax statement,  \\nv. pre-filled editable gst return, and  \\nvi. staggering of returns filing.  \\nthe capacity of gstn system has also been enhanced.  we have also \\ndeployed deep analytics and artificial intelligence to identi fy tax evaders \\nand fake billers and launch ed special drives against them.  \\n175. the re sults speak for themselves. we have made record collections \\nin the last few months.  \\n \\n176. the gst  council has painstakingly thrashed out thorny issues. as \\nchairperson of the council, i want to assure the house that we shall take \\nevery possible measure to smoothen the gst further, and remove \\nanomalies such as the inverted duty structure.  \\n \\ncustom duty r ationalization  \\n177. our custom duty policy should have the twin objective of promoting \\ndomestic manufacturing and helping india get onto global value chain and 34 \\n \\nexport better. the thrust now has to be on easy access to raw materials and \\nexports of value added pr oducts.  \\n \\n178. towards this, last year, we started overhauling the customs duty \\nstructure, eliminating 80 outdated exemptions.  i also thank everyone who \\nresponded overwhelmingly to a crowd -sourcing call for suggestions on this \\nrevamp. i now propose to review mo re than 400 old exemptions this year.  \\nwe will conduct this through extensive consultations, and from 1st october \\n2021, we will put in place a revised customs duty structure, free of \\ndistortions. i also propose that any new customs duty exemption \\nhencefort h will have validity up to the 31st march following two years from \\nthe date of its issue.  \\n \\nelectronic and mobile phone industry  \\n179. domestic electronic manufacturing has grown rapidly. we are now \\nexporting items like mobiles and chargers. for greater domestic value \\naddition, we are withdrawing a few exemptions on parts of chargers and \\nsub-parts of mobiles. further, some parts of mobiles will move from ‘nil’ \\nrate to a moderate 2.5%.  \\n \\niron and steel  \\n180. msmes  and other user industries have been severely hit by a recent \\nsharp rise in iron and steel prices.  therefore, we are reducing customs duty \\nuniformly to 7.5% on semis, flat, and long products of non -alloy, alloy, and \\nstainless steels. to provide relief to metal re -cyclers, mostly msmes, i am \\nexempting duty on steel scrap for a period up to 31st march, 2022.  further, \\ni am also revoking add and cvd on certain steel products. also, to provide \\nrelief to copper recyclers, i am reducing duty on copper scrap from  5% to \\n2.5%.  \\n \\ntextile  \\n181. the textiles sector generates employment and contributes \\nsignificantly to the economy. there is a need to rationalize duties on raw \\nmaterial inputs to manmade textiles.  we are now bringing nylon chain on \\npar with polyester and other man -made fibers. we are uniformly reducing 35 \\n \\nthe bcd rates on caprolactam, nylon chips and nylon fiber & yarn to 5%. \\nthis will help the textile industry, msmes, and exports, too.  \\n \\nchemicals  \\n182. we have calibrated customs duty rates on chemicals to encourage \\ndom estic value addition and to remove inversions.  apart from other items, \\nwe are reducing customs duty on naptha to 2.5% to correct inversion.  \\ngold and silver  \\n183. gold and silver presently attract a basic customs duty of 12.5%. \\nsince the duty was raised from 10%  in july 2019, prices of precious metals \\nhave risen sharply. to bring it closer to previous levels, we are rationalizing \\ncustom duty on gold and silver.  \\n \\nrenewable energy  \\n184. in part a, we have already acknowledged that solar energy has huge \\npromise for india . to build up domestic capacity, we will notify a phased \\nmanufacturing plan for solar cells and solar panels. at present, to encourage \\ndomestic production, we are raising duty on solar invertors from 5% to 20%, \\nand on solar lanterns from 5% to 15%.  \\n \\ncapita l equipment  and auto parts  \\n185. there is immense potential in manufacturing heavy capital \\nequipment domestically. we will comprehensively review the rate structure \\nin due course. however, we are revising duty rates on certain items \\nimmediately.  we propose to w ithdraw exemptions on tunnel boring \\nmachine. it will attract a customs duty of 7.5%; and its parts a duty of 2.5%. \\nwe are raising customs duty on certain auto parts to 15% to bring them on \\npar with general rate on auto parts.  \\nmsme products  \\n186. we are proposin g certain changes to benefit msmes. we are \\nincreasing duty from 10% to 15% on steel screws and plastic builder wares. \\non prawn feed we increase it from 5% to 15%. we are rationalizing \\nexemption on import of duty -free items as an incentive to exporters of 36 \\n \\ngarments, leather, and handicraft items. almost all these items are made \\ndomestically by our msmes. we are withdrawing exemption on imports of \\ncertain kind of leathers as they are domestically produced in good quantity \\nand quality, mostly by msmes. we are a lso raising customs duty on finished \\nsynthetic gem stones to encourage their domestic processing.  \\n \\nagriculture products  \\n187. to benefit farmers, we are raising customs duty on cotton from nil \\nto 10% and on raw silk and silk yarn from 10% to 15%. we are also \\nwithdrawing end -use based concession on denatured ethyl alcohol. \\ncurrently, rates are being uniformly calibrated to 15% on items like maize \\nbran, rice bran oil cake, and animal feed additives.  \\n \\n188.  there is an immediate need to improve agricultural infrastruc ture \\nso that we produce more, while also conserving and processing agricultural \\noutput efficiently. this will ensure enhanced remuneration for our farmers. \\nto earmark resources for this purpose, i propose an agriculture \\ninfrastructure and development cess (aidc) on a small number of items. \\nhowever, while applying this cess, we have taken care not to put additional \\nburden on consumers on most items.  \\n \\nrationalization of procedures and easing of compliance  \\n189. for their judicious application, we propose certain changes in the \\nprovisions relating to add and cvd levies. to complete customs \\ninvestigations, we are prescribing definite timelines. in 2020, we rolled out \\nthe turant customs initiative, which brought in faceless, paperless, and \\ncontactless customs measures. with effect from september 2020, we  have \\nimplemented a new procedure for administration of rules of origin. this \\nhas helped in putting a check on misuse of ftas.  \\n \\n190. the specific details of direct and  in direct tax changes proposed are \\nlisted in the annexure to my speech.  \\n \\n191. mr. speaker sir, with these words i commend the budget to this \\naugust house.  \\n 37 \\n \\nannex to part a of budget

learning – pedagogy for all levels of school \\neducation will be developed.  this will transform classroom \\ntransactions from mundane and rote learning to an e ngaging and \\njoyful experience.  \\n\\uf0b7 a national digital educational architecture (ndear ) will be set up \\nwithin the context of a digital first mindset where the digital \\narchitecture will not only support teaching and learning activities but \\nalso educational planning, governance and administrative activities of \\nthe centre and the states/ union  territories.  it will provide a diverse \\neducation eco -system architecture for development of digital \\ninfrastructure, a federated but inter operable system that will ensure \\nautonomy of all stakeholders, specially states and uts.  \\n\\uf0b7 for children with hearing impairments, the government will work on \\nstandardization of indian sign language across the country, and \\ndevelop national and state curriculum materials for use by them.   \\n\\uf0b7 there are a number of senior and retired teachers.  they will be used \\nfor individual  mentoring of school teachers and educators through \\nconstant online/offline support on subjects, themes and pedagogy.  \\n\\uf0b7 students have so far been evaluated on uni -dimensional parameters.  \\nthere will be a complete shift from using assessments to not only \\njudg e the cognitive levels of the learner but also using it as an \\nopportunity to identify the unique strengths and the potential of the \\nchild. to this effect, a holistic progress card is envisaged to provide \\nstudents with valuable information on their strength s, areas of \\ninterest, needed areas of focus and thereby helping them in making \\noptimal career choices.    \\n\\uf0b7 to enable increased access of resources, online modules covering the \\nentire gamut of adult education will be introduced.   \\n\\uf0b7 during the year, despite th e covid -19 pandemic, we have trained \\nmore than 30 lakh elementary school teachers digitally, covering the 42 \\n \\nwhole gamut of education.   taking this further, in 2021 -22, we will \\nenable the training of 56 lakh school teachers through the national \\ninitiative fo r school heads and teachers for holistic advancement \\n(nistha).  \\n\\uf0b7 for the past few years our prime minister has been engaging with \\nstudents every year before their board exams to help them overcome \\nanxiety and stress.  in this direction, we will introduce cbs e board \\nexam reforms in a phased manner to be effective from the 2022 -23 \\nacademic session.  exams will move away from rote -learning and \\nstudents shall be tested on their conceptual clarity, analytical skills and \\napplication of knowledge to real life situat ions.  \\n\\uf0b7

up to  \\n 5 lakh do not pay any income tax in both old and new tax regimes i \\npropose to increase the rebate limit to  7 lakh in the new tax regime thus \\npersons in the new tax regime with income up to  7 lakh will not have to \\npay any tax  \\n147 the second proposal relates to middleclass individuals \\n i had introduced in the year 2020 the new personal income tax regime \\nwith six income slabs starting from  25 lakh i propose to change the tax \\nstructure in this regime by reducing the number of slabs to five and \\nincreasing the tax exemption limit to  3 lakh the new tax rates are \\n 03 lakh nil \\n 36 lakh 5 per cent \\n 69 lakh 10 per cent \\n 912 lakh 15 per cent \\n 1215 lakh 20 per cent \\nabove  15 lakh 30 per cent \\n \\n148 this will provide major relief to all tax payers in the new regime an \\nindividual with an annual income of  9 lakh will be required to pay only  \\n 45000 this is only 5 per cent of his or her income it is a reduction of 25 \\nper cent on what he or she is required to pay now ie  60000 similarly \\nan individual with an income of  15 lakh would be required to pay only  \\n 15 lakh or 10 per cent of his or her income a reduction of 20

tax is regarding the \\nhighest tax rate which in our country is 4274 per cent this is among the \\nhighest in the world i propose to reduce the highest surcharge rate from 37 \\nper cent to 25 per cent in the new tax regime this would result in reduction \\nof the maximum tax rate to 39 per cent \\n151 lastly the limit of  3 lakh for tax exemption on leave encashment \\non retirement of nongovernment salaried employees was last fixed in the \\nyear 2002 when the highest basic pay in the government was  30000 \\npm in line with the increase in government salaries i am proposing to \\nincrease this limit to  25 lakh \\n152 we are also making the new income tax regime as the default tax \\nregime however citizens will continue to have the option to avail the \\nbenefit of the old tax regime \\n153 apart from these i am also making some other changes as given in \\nthe annexure \\n154 as a result of these proposals revenue of about  38000 crore –  \\n 37000 crore in direct

two years from the end of the \\nrelevant assessment year  \\n \\n122     presently if the department finds out that some income has been \\nmissed out by the assessee it goes through a lengthy

\\nhowever such deduction is allowed only to the extent of 10  per cent  of the \\nsalary in case of employees of the state government  to provide equal \\ntreatment to both central and state

these aops has to suffer a \\ngraded surcharge upto 37  per cent  which is a lot more than the \\nsurcharge on the individual companies accordingly i propose to cap \\nthe surcharge of these aop’s at 15  per cent  \\n\\uf0b7 further the long term capital gains on listed equity shares units etc \\nare liable to maximum surcharge of 15  per cent  while the other long \\nterm capital gains are

detected in search operations it has been \\nobserved that in many cases where undisclosed income or suppression of \\nsales etc is detected payment of tax is avoided by setting off of losses in

goods by 2025  this would create employment opportunities and \\nresult in increased economic activity however several duty exemptions \\neven extending to over three decade s in some cases have been granted to \\ncapital goods for various sectors like power fertilizer textiles leather \\nfootwear food processin g and fertilizers these exemptions have hindered \\nthe growth of the domestic capital goods sector   27 \\n \\n143  similarl y project import duty concessions have also deprived the \\nlocal producers of a level playing field in areas like coal mining projects \\npower generation transmission or distribution projects railway and metro \\nprojects our experience suggests that reasona ble tariffs are conducive to \\nthe growth of domestic industry and ‘make in india’ without significantly \\nimpacting the cost of essential imports  \\n144  accordingly it is proposed to phase out the concessional rates in \\ncapital goods and project imports gradu ally and apply a moderate tariff of \\n75 per cent  certain exemptions for advanced machineries that are not \\nmanufactured within the country shall continue  \\n145  a few exemptions are being introduced on inputs like

350 exemption entries are proposed to be gradually phased out these \\ninclude exemption on certain agricultural produce chemicals fabrics \\nmedical devices and drugs and me dicines for which sufficient domestic \\ncapacity exists  further as a simplification measure several concessional \\nrates are being incorporated in the customs tariff schedule itself instead of \\nprescribing them through various notifications   \\n147  this com prehensive review will simplify the customs rate and tariff \\nstructure particularly for sectors like chemicals textiles and metals and \\nminimise disputes removal of exemption on items which are or can be \\nmanufactured in india and providing concessional dut ies on raw material \\nthat go into manufacturing of intermediate products will go many a step \\nforward in achieving our objective of ‘make in india’ and ‘atmanirbhar \\nbharat’  \\n148  i shall now take up sector specific proposals  \\nelectronics  \\n149  electronic manu

honourable speaker the preparation of this budget was undertaken \\nin circumstances like never before we knew of calamities that have \\naffected a country or a region within a country but what we have endured \\nwith covid 19 through 2020 is sui generis  \\n \\n2 whe n i presented the budget 2020 21 we could not have imagined \\nthat the global economy already in throes of a slowdown would be pushed \\ninto an unprecedented contraction  \\n \\n3 we could not have also imagined then that our people as those in \\nother countries would have to endure the loss of near and dear ones and \\nsuffer hardships brought about due to a health crisis  \\n \\n4 the risk of not having a lockdown was far too high within 48 hours \\nof declaring a three week long complete lockdown the prime minister \\nannounc ed the pradhan mantri garib kalyan yojana valued at 276 lakh \\ncrores  – this provided  free food grain to 800 million people free cooking \\ngas for 80 million families for months and cash directly to over 400 million \\nfarmers women elderly the poor and  the needy  \\n \\n 2 \\n \\n \\n 5 even as a large section of citizens stayed home milk vegetable and \\nfruit suppliers health and sanitary workers truck drivers railways and \\npublic transport workers bank employees electricity workers our \\nannadata s police firemen and  the armed forces all had to go about their \\nwork as normal but with the additional anxiety of the virus hanging over \\nthem we recognise this and i think i speak on behalf of everybody in this \\naugust house when i express my heartfelt gratitude to these men and \\nwomen for how they were able to carry out their work and duty to provide \\nfor the nation’s basics over those crucial months  \\n \\n6 speaker sir for public good honourable members of parliament \\nand members of legislative assemblies too offered their s alaries  \\n \\n7 in may 2020 the government announced the atmanirbhar bharat \\npackage anb 10  to sustain the recovery further into the year we also \\nrolled out two more atmanirbhar bharat packages anb 20 and anb 30 \\ntotal financial impact of all atmanirbh ar bharat packages including \\nmeasures taken by rbi was estimated to about 271 lakh crores  which \\namounts to more than 13 of gdp  \\n \\n8 as a government we kept a watch on the situation and were \\nproactive in our responses the government led by the prime minister \\nstretched its resources to deliver for most vulnerable sections of our society \\n– the poorest of the poor the dalits tribals  the elderly the migrant \\nworkers and our children the pmgky the three anb packages and \\nannouncements made later were like five mini budgets in themselves  \\n \\n9 the atmanirbhar packages accelerated our pace of structural \\nreforms redefinition of msmes  commercialisation of the mineral sector \\nagriculture and labour reforms privatisation of public sector undertakings \\none nation one ration card and production linked incentive schemes are \\nsome of the notable reforms carried out during this period  fac eless \\nincome tax assessment dbt and financial inclusion are the others  \\n \\n10 today india has two vaccines available and has begun medically \\nsafeguarding not only her own citizens against covid 19 but also those of \\n100 or more countries it is added comfor t to know that two or more \\nvaccines are also expected soon  \\n 3 \\n \\n \\n 11 honourable prime minister launched the vaccination drive by \\ncrediting and thanking our scientists we are ever grateful for the strength \\nand rigour of their efforts  \\n \\n12 having said that we are all  reminded time and again that our fight \\nagainst covid 19 continues into 2021  \\n \\n13 now just as it had happened after the two world wars there are \\nsigns that the political economic and strategic relations in the post covid \\nworld are changing this moment in  history is the dawn of a new era – one \\nin which india is well poised to truly be the land of promise and hope  \\n \\nfaith is the bird that feels the light and sings when the dawn is still dark  \\nrabindranath tagore  \\nfireflies – a collection of aphorisms  \\n \\n14 in this spirit i can’t help but recall the joy that we as a cricket loving \\nnation felt after team india’s recent spectacular success in australia it has \\nreminded us of all the qualities that we as a people particularly our youth \\nepitomise of having  abundant promise and the unsuppressed thirst to \\nperform and succeed  \\n \\n15 today data shows that india now has one of the lowest death rate \\nof 112 per million  population and one of the lowest active cases of  about \\n130 per million this has laid the foundation  to the revival we are seeing \\nnow in the economy  \\n \\n16 this budget will be the first of this new decade this budget will also \\nbe a digital budget and that has happened with all your support  \\n \\n17 so far only three times has a budget followed a contraction in the  \\neconomy all such contractions were as a result of situations typical to \\nindia this time the contraction in our economy is due to a global \\npandemic just like in several other countries  \\n \\n18 having said that i want to confidently state that our government  is \\nfully prepared to support and facilitate the economy’s reset this budget \\nprovides every opportunity for our economy to raise and capture the pace \\nthat it needs for sustainable growth  \\n \\n19 2021 is the year of many important milestones for our history i \\nmention a few of these it is the 75th year of independence 60 years of \\ngoa’s accession to india 50 years of the 1971 india pakistan war it will be 4 \\n \\n \\n the year of the 8th census of independent india it will also be india’s turn \\nat the brics presidency the  year for our chandrayaan 3 mission and the \\nharidwar maha kumbh  \\n \\n20 honourable speaker before i commence part a of the budget i \\nwant to take a moment to acknowledge how isolating and distancing \\nseemed like insurmountable challenges for a country like ours  that has \\npeople coming together in times of crises it hurt us in many ways i bow my \\nhead in respect to every citizen for the endurance shown in facing what \\nwas an undeniably a tough year for all our physical and mental well being  \\n \\n \\npart a  \\n \\n21 in part a  i wish to lay a vision for atmanirbhar bharat  \\n \\n22 atmanirbharta is not a new idea ancient india was largely self \\nreliant and equally a business epicentre of the world  \\n \\n23 atmanirbhar bharat is an expression of 130 crores  indians who have \\nfull confidence in their capabilities and skills  \\n \\n24 we are already part of international groupings such as the g20

mahotsav of 2022 on the 75th year of our independence \\nthey too resonate  with this vision of atmanirbharta  \\n \\n27 the budget proposals for 202 12022 rest on 6 pillars  \\ni health and wellbeing

celebrations  \\n \\n138 i propose to provide 1000 crores for the welfare of tea workers \\nespecially women and their children in assam and west bengal a special \\nscheme will be devised for the same  \\n \\n \\nfiscal position  \\n \\n139 in these last few paragraphs of part a of my speech i draw the \\nattention of this august house to the fact that at the beginning of the \\ncurrent financial year the pandemic’s impact on the economy resulted in a \\nweak revenue inflow this was combined with high expenditure t o provide \\nessential relief to vulnerable sections of the society especially the poor \\nwomen scs and sts  \\n \\n140  unlike many other countries we opted for a series of medium sized \\npackages during the pandemic so that we could calibrate and target our \\nresponse a ccording to an evolving situation once the health situation \\nstabilised and the lockdown was being slowly lifted we switched to \\nramping up government spending so as to revive domestic demand as a \\nresult against an original be expenditure of 3042 lakh  crores for 2020 \\n2021 our re estimates are 3450 lakh crores we have maintained the 26 \\n \\n \\n quality of expenditure the capital expenditure estimated in re is  439 \\nlakh crores in 2020 2021 as against 412 lakh crores in b e 2020 21 \\n \\n141 the fiscal deficit in re  2020 21 is pegged at 95  of gdp  we have \\nfunded this through government borrowings multilateral borrowings small \\nsaving funds and short term borrowings we would need another  80000 \\ncrores  for which we would be approaching the markets in these 2 months \\nto ensure that the economy is given the required push our be estimates for \\nexpenditure in 2021 2022 are 3483  lakh crores this includes  554 lakh \\ncrores as capital expenditure an incr ease of  345  over the be figure of \\n2020 2021 the fiscal deficit in be 2021 2022 is estimated to be 68 of \\ngdp  the gross borrowing from the market for the next year would be \\naround 12 lakh crores we plan to continue with our path of fiscal \\nconsolidati on and intend to reach a fiscal deficit level below 45 of gdp by \\n2025 2026 with a fairly steady decline over the period we hope to achieve \\nthe consolidation by first increasing the buoyancy of tax revenue through \\nimproved compliance and secondly  by increased receipts from \\nmonetisation of assets including public sector enterprises and land  the \\ncontingency fund of india is being proposed to be augmented from 500 \\ncrores  to 30000 crores  through finance bill  \\n  \\n \\n142 in accordance with the views of the 15th finance commission we \\nare allowing a normal ceiling of net borrowing for the states at 4 of gsdp \\nfor the year 2021 2022 a portion of this ceiling will be earmarked to be \\nspent on incremental capital expenditure additional borrowing ceiling of \\n05 o f gsdp will also be provided subject to conditions states will be \\nexpected to reach a fiscal deficit of 3 of gsdp by 2023 24 as \\nrecommended by the 15th finance commission  \\n \\n143  in the july 2019 2020 budget i introduced the statement 27 on \\nextra budgetary resources – it disclosed the borrowings of government \\nagencies that went towards funding goi schemes and whose repayment \\nburden was on the government in my 2020 2021 budget i enhanced the \\nscope and coverage of the statement by including the loans provi ded by \\ngovernment to the fci taking a step further in this direction  i   propose  to \\ndiscontinue the nssf loan to fci for food subsidy and accordingly budget \\nprovisions have been made in re 202021 and be 2021 22 the extra \\nbudgetary resources details are  at annexure vi  27 \\n \\n \\n 144 we know that the frbm act mandates fiscal deficit of 3 of gdp to \\nbe achieved by 31st march 2020 2021 the effect of this year’s unforeseen \\nand unprecedented circumstances has necessitated the submission of a \\ndeviation statement under sect ions 4 5 and 7 3 b of the frbm act \\nwhich i am laying on the table of the house as part of the frbm \\ndocuments  \\n \\n145 towards achieving central government fiscal deficit along the broad \\npath that i have already indicated i will be introducing an amendment to \\nthe frbm act  \\n \\n146 on 9th december 2020 the 15th finance commission submitted its \\nfinal report covering the period 2021 2026 to the rashtrapati ji the \\ngovernment has laid the commission’s report along with the explanatory \\nmemorandum in the parliament retaining the vertical shares of the states at \\n41 we recognise our

the \\npandemic and its aftershock in these trying times when many economies \\nare struggling to revive our people and our industry have exhibited \\nremarkable resilience  \\n \\n148 as i mentioned already post pandemic a new world order seems to \\nbe emerging one in which asia is poised to occupy a prominent position \\nand india will have a leading role therein  in this scenario our tax system \\nhas to be transparent efficient and sh ould promote investments and \\nemployment in our country at the same time it should put minimum \\nburden on our tax payers  \\n \\nஇய\\x82ற´\\x7f

\\nmonths prior to the pandemic   in order to attract investments  we slashed \\nour corporate tax rate to make it among the lowest in the world the \\ndividend distribution tax too was abolished the

and in serious tax fraud cases for up to 10 years as a result \\ntaxpayers have to remain under uncertainty for a long time  \\n \\n154 i therefore propose to reduce this time limit for re opening of \\nassessment to 3 years from the present 6 years in serious tax evasion cases \\ntoo only where there is evidence of concealment of income of  50 lakh or \\nmore in a year can the assessment be re opened up to 10 years even this \\nreopening can be don e only after the approval of the principal chief \\ncommissioner the highest level of the income tax department  \\n \\nsetting up the dispute

direct tax vivad se vishwas \\nscheme to give taxpayers an opportunity to settle long pending disputes \\nand be relieved of further strain on their time and resources the response  \\nfrom the taxpayer s has been the best ever as  over 1 lakh ten thousand  \\ntaxpayers have already opted to settle tax disputes of over  85000 crores  \\nunder this scheme  \\n \\n 30 \\n \\n157 to further reduce litigation for small taxpayers i propose to \\nconstitute a dispute resolution committee  for them  which will be faceless \\nto ensure efficiency transparency and accountability anyone with a

have to get your \\naccounts audi ted in the february 2020 budget i had increased the limit for \\ntax audit to  5 crore for those who carry out 95 of their transactions \\ndigitally to further

sector we had granted 100 tax exemption subject to \\ncertain conditions to foreign sovereign wealth funds and pension funds \\non their income from investment in indian i nfras tructure we have noticed \\nthat few of such funds are facing difficulties in meeting some of these \\nconditions in order to ensure that a large number of funds invest in india i \\npropose to relax some of these conditions relating to prohibition on priva te \\nfunding restriction on commercial activities and direct investment in \\ninfrastructure     \\n \\n164 in order to allow funding of infrastructure by

\\n165 this government sees ‘housing for all’ and affordable housing as \\npriority areas in the july 2019 budget  i provided an additional deduction of \\ninterest amounting to  15 lakh for loan

available for loans taken up till 31st march 202 2 for the \\npurchase of an affordable house  \\n \\n166 further to keep up the supply of affordable houses i propose that \\naffordable housing

far there is a blanket \\nexemption to such entities whose annual receipt  does not exceed   \\n1 crore i now propose to increase this amount to  5 crore  \\n \\nlabour welfare  \\n171 we have noticed that some employers deduct the contribution of \\nemployees towards  provident  funds superannuation funds  and other \\nsocial security funds but do not deposit these contributions within the \\nspecified time for the employees this means a loss of interest or income \\nin cases where an employer later becomes financial ly unviable non deposit \\nresults in a permanent loss for the employees  33 \\n \\n172 in order to ensure that employees’ contributions are deposited on \\ntime i reiterate that the late deposit of employee’s contribution by the \\nemployer will not be allowed as deduction to the employer  \\n \\nincentives for start ups \\n173 in order to incentivise  start ups in the country i propose to extend \\nthe eligibility for claiming tax holiday for start ups by

measure to smoothen the gst further and remove \\nanomalies such as the inverted duty structure  \\n \\ncustom duty r ationalization  \\n177 our custom duty policy should have the twin objective of promoting \\ndomestic manufacturing and helping india get onto global value chain and 34 \\n \\nexport better the thrust now has to be on easy access to raw materials and \\nexports of value added pr oducts  \\n \\n178 towards this last year we started overhauling the customs duty \\nstructure eliminating 80 outdated exemptions  i also thank everyone who \\nresponded overwhelmingly to a crowd sourcing call for suggestions on this \\nrevamp i now propose to review mo re than 400 old exemptions this year  \\nwe will conduct this through extensive consultations and from 1st october \\n2021 we

from \\nthe date of its issue  \\n \\nelectronic and mobile phone industry  \\n179 domestic electronic manufacturing has grown rapidly we are now \\nexporting items like mobiles and chargers for greater domestic value \\naddition we are withdrawing a few exemptions on parts of chargers and \\nsubparts of mobiles further some parts of mobiles will move from ‘nil’ \\nrate to a moderate 25  \\n \\niron and steel  \\n180 msmes  and other user industries have been severely hit by a recent \\nsharp rise in iron and steel prices  therefore we are reducing customs duty \\nuniformly to 75 on semis

\\npar with polyester and other man made fibers we are uniformly reducing 35 \\n \\nthe bcd rates on caprolactam nylon chips and nylon fiber  yarn to 5 \\nthis will help the textile industry msmes and exports too  \\n \\nchemicals  \\n182 we have calibrated customs duty rates on chemicals to encourage \\ndom estic value addition and to remove inversions  apart from other items \\nwe are reducing customs duty on naptha to 25 to correct inversion  \\ngold and silver  \\n183 gold and silver presently attract a basic customs duty of 125 \\nsince the duty was raised from 10  in july 2019 prices of

manufacturing heavy capital \\nequipment domestically we will comprehensively review the rate structure \\nin due course however we are revising duty rates on certain items \\nimmediately  we propose to w ithdraw exemptions on tunnel boring \\nmachine it will attract a customs duty of 75 and its parts a duty of 25 \\nwe are raising customs duty on certain auto parts to 15 to bring them on \\npar with general rate on auto parts  \\nmsme products  \\n186 we are proposin g certain changes to benefit msmes we are \\nincreasing duty from 10 to 15 on steel screws and plastic builder wares \\non

and processing agricultural \\noutput efficiently this will ensure enhanced remuneration for our farmers \\nto earmark resources for this purpose i propose an agriculture \\ninfrastructure and development cess aidc on a small number of items \\nhowever while applying this cess we have taken care not to put additional \\nburden on consumers on most items  \\n \\nrationalization of procedures and easing of compliance  \\n189 for their judicious application we propose certain changes in the \\nprovisions relating to add and cvd levies to complete customs \\ninvestigations we are prescribing definite timelines in 2020 we rolled out \\nthe turant customs initiative which brought in faceless paperless and \\ncontactless customs measures with effect from september 2020 we  have
