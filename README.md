The dataset i'm working with is a PDF containing the "Interim Budget 2024-2025" speech by Nirmala Sitharaman, the Finance Minister of India. The document includes a structured breakdown of the speech, with sections like introduction, inclusive development, economic management, infrastructure development, and specific details on direct and indirect taxes. The text outlines key government initiatives, fiscal policies, and the vision for India's future economic growth.

 Topic Modeling Context:
In this context, topic modeling would involve identifying key themes such as economic growth, social justice, infrastructure development, and tax reforms, which are recurrent throughout the document. These themes could then be used to categorize and analyze the content, providing insights into the focus areas of the budget speech.
